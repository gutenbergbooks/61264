  <h2 class='c008'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Among the many arguments that have recently
been advanced in support of imperialistic ambitions
and statesmanship, there is one that justifies
and demands aggression in the interest of human
culture. According to this rather plausible political
philosophy, it is the destiny of the smaller states
to be absorbed into the larger and stronger. The
application is not to be limited to the so-called
“backward races”; it is also extended to the lesser
peoples of Europe. These have, it is held, no real
right to an independent existence; only the great,
the powerful, and the mighty can claim this privilege,
for they alone are able to render the higher
forms of service to civilization.</p>

<p class='c010'>To this theory the history of the Scandinavian
lands provides a complete and striking refutation.
In the drama of European development the Northern
countries have played important and honorable
parts; but except for a brilliant period in Swedish
history (chiefly during the seventeenth century)
they have never weighed heavily in the Continental
balance. Their geographical situation is unfavorable
and their economic resources have never been
comparable to those of the more prominent states
beyond the Baltic and the North Sea. But when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>we come to the kingdom of intellect the story is a
totally different one. The literary annals of Europe
in the nineteenth century give prominence to a
series of notable Scandinavian writers who not only
achieved recognition in their own lands but found
a place in the competition for leadership in the
world at large. The productivity of the Northern
mind is not of recent origin, however; the literatures
of Scandinavia have a history that leads back into
the days of heathen worship more than a thousand
years ago.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps the most effective illustration of what a
fruitful intellect can accomplish even when placed
in the most unpromising environment is medieval
Iceland. Along the western and southwestern
coasts of the island lay a straggling settlement of
Norwegian immigrants whose lives were spent
chiefly in a struggle to force the merest subsistence
from a niggardly soil. And yet, in the later middle
ages and even earlier, there was a literary activity
on these Arctic shores which, in output as well as
in quality, compares favorably with that of any part
of contemporary Europe. Evidently intellectual
greatness bears but slight relation to economic advantages
or political power. What was true of Iceland
was also true of Norway, though in a lesser
degree. In that country, too, life was in great
measure a continuous struggle with the soil and
the sea. Still, even in that land and age, the spirits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>were active, the arts flourished, and the North
added her contribution to the treasures of European
culture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The poems and tales of those virile days, the
eddas and sagas, are too familiar to need more
than a mention in this connection. But the fact
is not so commonly known that the medieval
Northmen were thinkers and students as well as
poets and romancers. They, too, were interested in
the mysteries of the universe, in the problems of
science, and in the intricate questions of social relationships.
In their thinking on these matters
they showed more intellectual independence and
less slavish regard for venerable authority than was
usually the case among medieval writers. And of
all the men who in that age of faith tried to analyse
and set in order their ideas of the world in which
they moved, perhaps none drew more largely on his
own spiritual resources than the unknown author
of the <i>King’s Mirror</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unlike the sagas and related writings, the purpose
of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> is utilitarian and didactic.
The author has before him a group of serious and
important problems, which he proceeds to discuss
for the instruction of his readers. Consequently,
certain qualities of style that are often associated
with Old Norse literature are not apparent in his
work to any marked degree. In his effort to make
his language clear, definite, and intelligible, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>author sometimes finds it necessary to repeat and
restate his ideas, with the result that his literary
style is frequently stiff, labored, and pedantic.
These defects are, however, not characteristic of
the book as a whole. Many of its chapters display
rare workmanship and prove that the author of
the <i>King’s Mirror</i> is one of the great masters of
Old Norse prose.</p>

<p class='c010'>In preparing the translation of this unique work,
my aim has been to reproduce the author’s thought
as faithfully as possible and to state it in such a
form as to satisfy the laws of English syntax. But
I have also felt that, so far as it can be done, the
flavor of the original should be retained and that a
translator, in his effort to satisfy certain conventional
demands of modern composition, should not
deviate too far from the path of mental habit that
the author has beaten in his roamings through the
fields of thought. Peculiarities of style and expression,
can, it is true, usually not be reproduced
in another language; at the same time it is possible to
ignore these considerations to such an extent that
the product becomes a paraphrase rather than a
translation; and I have believed that such a rendition
should be avoided, even at the risk of erring on the
side of literalness.</p>

<p class='c010'>The importance of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> as a source
of information in the study of medieval thought
was first brought to my attention by Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>Julius E. Olson of the University of Wisconsin, who
has also, since the work of preparing this edition
was begun, followed its progress with helpful interest.
Professors G. T. Flom and A. H. Lybyer
of the University of Illinois, and Professor W. H.
Schofield of Harvard University, have read the
manuscript in whole or part and have contributed
many valuable suggestions. My wife, Lillian May
Larson, has assisted in a great variety of ways,
as in all my work. Dr. H. G. Leach of the
American-Scandinavian Foundation has read the proof
sheets of the entire volume and has suggested
many improvements in the text. To all these
persons I wish to express my thanks. I am also
deeply indebted to the trustees of the American-Scandinavian
Foundation whose generosity has
made it possible to publish the work at this time.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>The place of the thirteenth century in the history
of human achievement is a subject upon which
scholars have not yet come to a general agreement.
There can be no doubt that it was, on the whole, an age
of progress in many fields; but there is much in its history
that points to stagnation, if not to actual decline.
From a superficial study of its annals one might be led
to class it with the lesser centuries; most writers are inclined
to rank it lower than the fourteenth century, and
perhaps not even so high as the twelfth. It was in this
period that the crusading movement finally flickered out
and the Christian world was compelled to leave the
cradle of the holy faith in the hands of the infidel. In the
thirteenth century, too, the medieval empire sank into
hopeless inefficiency and all but expired. The papacy,
which more than any other power was responsible for
the ruin of the imperial ambitions, also went into decline.
Whether the loss in authority and prestige on the
part of the holy see was compensated by a renewed
spiritual energy in the church at large may well be
doubted: what evidence we have would indicate that
the religion of the masses was gross and materialistic,
that ethical standards were low, and that the improvement
in clerical morals, which the church had hoped
would follow the enforcement of celibacy, had failed to
appear.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Yet the thirteenth century also had its attractive figures
and its important movements. The old social order
was indeed crumbling, but in its place appeared two
new forces which were to inherit the power and opportunities
of feudalism and reshape social life: these were
the new monarchy, enjoying wide sovereign powers, and
the new national consciousness, which was able to think
in larger units. In England the century saw the development
of a new representative institution, which has become
the mother of modern legislative assemblies. The
Italian cities were growing rich from the profits of Oriental
trade; in the Flemish towns the weaver’s industry
was building up new forms of municipal life; the great
German Hansa was laying hold on the commerce of the
northern seas. In the realms of higher intellect, in
science, philosophy, and theology, the age was a notable
one, with Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas
Aquinas as the leaders, each in his field. The century
also meant much for the progress of geographical knowledge,
for it was in this period that Marco Polo penetrated
the mysterious lands of the Far East.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the historian looks back into this age, he is, therefore,
able to find broad traces of much that is regarded
as fundamental to modern life. Of first importance in
this regard is the employment of popular idioms in literary
productions. French literature saw its beginnings in
the eleventh century with the <i>chansons de geste</i>, songs of
valorous deeds from the heroic age of the Frankish
kingdom. In the next century the poets began to use the
themes of the Arthurian legends and sang the exploits
of the famous British king and the knights of his Round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Table. A little later came another cycle of poems based
on the heroic tales of classical antiquity. The twelfth
century witnessed a parallel movement in Germany,
which at first was largely an imitation of contemporary
French poetry. The poets, however, soon discovered
literary treasures in the dim world of the Teutonic past,
in the tales of the Nibelungs, in the heroic deeds of
Theodoric, and in the exploits of other heroes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus in the first half of the thirteenth century there
was a large body of French and German verse in circulation.
The verses were borne from region to region and
from land to land by professional entertainers, who
chanted the poems, and by pilgrims and other travelers,
who secured manuscript copies. In the course of time
the new tales reached the Northern countries, and it
was not long before the Northmen were eagerly listening
to the stories of chivalrous warfare, militant religion,
and tragic love, that they had learned in the southlands.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Northern peoples thus had a share in the fruitage
of the later middle ages; but they also had a share in
their achievements. Politically as well as intellectually
the thirteenth century was a great age in the Scandinavian
countries. The Danish kingdom rose to the highest
point of its power under Valdemar the Victorious,
whose troubled reign began in 1202. Valdemar succeeded
in extending the territories of Denmark along the entire
southern coast of the Baltic Sea; but the greatness was
short-lived: after the defeat of the Danes by the North
Germans at Börnhoved in 1227, the decline of Danish
imperialism began. In Sweden, too, men dreamed of
conquest beyond the sea. Under the leadership of Earl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Birger, the most eminent statesman of medieval Sweden,
Swedish power was steadily extended into Finnish territory,
and the foundations of Sweden as a great European
power was being laid.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the days of Valdemar and the great Birger
Norway also reached its greatest territorial extent. After
a century of factional warfare, the nation settled down
to comparative peace. All the Norwegian colonies except
those in Ireland, were definitely made subject to the
Norwegian crown: these were the Isle of Man, the Hebrides,
the Orkneys, the Shetlands, the Faroes, Iceland,
and Greenland. In every field of national life there was
vigor and enterprise. And on the throne sat a strong,
wise, and learned monarch, Hakon IV, the ruler with
the “great king-thought.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The real greatness of the thirteenth century in the
North lies, however, in the literary achievements of the
age. It is not known when the Old Norse poets first began
to exercise their craft, but the earliest poems that
have come down to us date from the ninth century. For
two hundred years the literary production was in the
form of alliterative verse; but after 1050 there came a
time when scaldic poetry did not seem to thrive. This
does not mean that the interest in literature died out;
it merely took a new form: the age of poetry was followed
by an age of prose. With the Christian faith came
the Latin alphabet and writing materials, and there was
no longer any need to memorize verse. The new form
was the saga, which began to appear in the twelfth
century and received many notable additions in the
thirteenth. The literary movement on the continent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>therefore, had its counterpart in the North; only here
the writings took the form of prose, while there literature
was chiefly in verse.</p>

<p class='c010'>These two currents came into contact in the first
half of the thirteenth century, when the men and women
of the North began to take an interest in the Arthurian
romances and other tales that had found their way
into Norway. In this new form of Norwegian literature
there could not be much originality; still its appearance
testifies to a widening of the intellectual horizon. In addition
to sagas and romances the period was also productive
of written laws, homilies, legends, Biblical
narratives, histories, and various other forms of literature.
It is to be noted that virtually everything was
written in the idiom of the common people. Latin was
used to some extent in the North in the later middle
ages, but it never came into such general use there
as in other parts of Europe. In the thirteenth century
it had almost passed out of use as a literary language.</p>

<p class='c010'>In our interest in tales and romances we must not
overlook the fact that the thirteenth century also produced
an important literature of the didactic type. For
centuries the Christian world had studied the encyclopedic
works of Capella, Cassiodorus, and Isidore, or had
read the writings of Bede and his many followers who
had composed treatises “on the nature of things,” in
which they had striven to set in order the known or
supposed facts of the physical world. The thirteenth
century had an encyclopedist of its own in Vincent of
Beauvais, who produced a vast compendium made up
of several <i>Specula</i>, which were supposed to contain all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the knowledge that the world possessed in science, history,
theology, and other fields of learning. The age also
produced various other Latin works of the didactic sort,
of which the <i>Historia Scholastica</i> of Petrus Comestor
was perhaps the most significant for the intellectual
history of the North.</p>

<p class='c010'>Norway had no encyclopedist, but the thirteenth
century produced a Norwegian writer who undertook a
task which was somewhat of the encyclopedic type.
Some time during the reign of Hakon IV, perhaps while
Vincent was composing his great <i>Speculum Majus</i>, a
learned Norseman wrote the <i>Speculum Regale</i>, or <i>King’s
Mirror</i>, a work which a competent critic has characterized
as “one of the chief ornaments of Old Norse literature.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Unlike the sagas and the romances, which have
in view chiefly the entertainment of the reader, the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> is didactic throughout; in a few chapters
only does the author depart from his serious purpose,
and all but two of these are of distinct value. The purpose
of the work is to provide a certain kind of knowledge
which will be of use to young men who are looking
forward to a career in the higher professions.</p>

<p class='c010'>As outlined in the introductory chapter, the work was
to deal with the four great orders of men in the Norwegian
kingdom: the merchants and their interests; the
king and his retainers; the church and the clergy; and
the peasantry or husbandmen. In the form in which the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> has come down to modern times, however,
the first two divisions only are included; not the
least fragment of any separate discussion of the clerical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>profession or of the agricultural classes has been found.
It is, therefore, generally believed that the work was not
completed beyond the point where the extant manuscripts
close. Why the book was left unfinished cannot
be known; but it is a plausible conjecture that illness or
perhaps death prevented the author, who was apparently
an aged man, from completing the task that he
had set before him. It is also possible that the ideas expressed
in the closing chapters of the work, especially in
the last chapter, which deals with the subject of clerical
subordination to the secular powers, were so repugnant
to the ecclesiastical thought of the time that the authorities
of the church discouraged or perhaps found
means to prevent the continuation of the work into the
third division, where the author had planned to deal
with the church and the clergy.</p>

<p class='c010'>In form the <i>Speculum</i> is a dialog between a wise and
learned father and his son, in which the larger part of
the discussion naturally falls to the former. The son
asks questions and suggests problems, which the father
promptly answers or solves. In the choice of form there
is nothing original: the dialog was frequently used by
didactic writers in the middle ages, and it was the
natural form to adopt. The title, <i>Speculum Regale</i>, is
also of a kind that was common in those days.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>Specula</i>
of many sorts were being produced: <i>Speculum Ecclesiae</i>,
<i>Speculum Stultorum</i>, <i>Speculum Naturale</i>, and <i>Speculum
Perfectionis</i> are some of the titles used for writings of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>didactic type. The German <i>Sachsenspiegel</i> is an instance
of the title employed for a work in a vulgar idiom. There
was also a <i>Speculum Regum</i>, or <i>Mirror of Kings</i>, and a
century later an English ecclesiastic wrote a <i>Speculum
Regis</i>, but the writer knows of no other work called the
<i>Speculum Regale</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is an interesting question whether the <i>King’s Mirror</i>
was inspired by any earlier work written along similar
lines. Originality was a rare virtue in the middle ages,
and the good churchmen who wrote books in those days
cannot have regarded plagiarism as a mortal sin. The
great writers were freely copied by the lesser men,
thoughts, titles, statements, and even the wording being
often taken outright. It is, therefore, difficult to determine
the sources of statements found in the later works,
as they may have been drawn from any one of a whole
series of writings on the subject under discussion. The
writer has not been able to make an exhaustive examination
of all the didactic and devotional literature of the
centuries preceding the thirteenth, but the search that
has been made has not proved fruitful. There is every
reason to believe that the author of the <i>King’s Mirror</i>
was an independent thinker and writer. He was doubtless
acquainted with a large number of books and had drawn
information from a great variety of sources; but when
the writing was actually done he had apparently a few
volumes only at his disposal. In the region where the
work seems to have been composed, on the northern
edge of European civilization, there was neither cathedral
nor monastery nor any other important ecclesiastical
foundation where a collection of books might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>found.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> It is likely, therefore, that the author had
access to such books only as were in his own possession.
But he came to his task with a well-stocked mind,
with a vast fund of information gathered by travel and
from the experiences of an active life; and thus he drew
largely from materials that had become the permanent
possession of his memory. This fact, if it be a fact, will
also help to explain why so many inaccuracies have crept
into his quoted passages; in but very few instances does
he give the correct wording of a citation.</p>

<p class='c010'>There can be no doubt that the author had a copy of
the <i>Vulgate</i> before him; at least one Biblical passage is
correctly given, and it is quoted in its Latin form.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> It
has also been discovered that he had access to an Old
Norse paraphrase of a part of the Old Testament, the
books of Samuel and of the Kings.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> It is likely that he
was also acquainted with some of the works of Saint
Augustine, and perhaps with the writings of certain
other medieval authorities. Among these it seems safe
to include the <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i>, a collection of tales
and ethical observations by Petrus Alfonsus, a converted
Jew who wrote in the first half of the twelfth century.
The <i>Disciplina</i> is a somewhat fantastic production
wholly unlike the sober pages of the <i>Speculum Regale</i>;
nevertheless, the two works appear to show certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>points of resemblance which can hardly have been accidental.
The <i>Disciplina</i> is a dialog and the part of the
son is much the same as in the <i>King’s Mirror</i>. In both
works the young man expresses a desire to become acquainted
with the customs of the royal court, inasmuch
as he may some day decide to apply for admission to
the king’s household service.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The description of courtly
manners and customs in the earlier dialog, though
much briefer than the corresponding discussion in the
Norwegian treatise, has some resemblance to the latter
which suggests a possible relationship between the two
works.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Norwegian author may also have used some of
the many commentaries on the books of Holy Writ, in
the production of which the medieval cloisters were so
prolific. Of the influence of Petrus Comestor’s <i>Historia
Scholastica</i> the writer has found no distinct trace in the
<i>King’s Mirror</i>; but one can be quite sure that he knew
and had used the <i>Elucidarium</i> of Honorius of Autun.
The <i>Elucidarium</i> is a manual of medieval theology
which was widely read in the later middle ages and was
translated into Old Norse, probably before the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> was written.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> But our Norwegian author was
not a slavish follower of earlier authorities: in his use
and treatment of materials drawn from the Scriptures
he shows remarkable independence. Remarkable at
least is his ability to make Biblical narratives serve to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>illustrate his own theories of Norwegian kingship. He
was acquainted with some of the legends that circulated
through the church and made effective use of them.
He must also have known a work on the marvels of
Ireland<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and the letter of Prester John to the Byzantine
emperor,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> in which that mythical priest-king recounts
the wonders of India. But the chief source of
his work is a long life full of action, conflict, thought,
and experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>The importance of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> lies in the insight
that it gives into the state of culture and civilization
of the North in the later middle ages. The interest
follows seven different lines: physical science, especially
such matters as are of importance to navigators;
geography, particularly the geography of the Arctic
lands and waters; the organization of the king’s household
and the privileges and duties of the king’s henchmen;
military engines, weapons, and armour used in
offensive and defensive warfare; ethical ideas, especially
rules of conduct for courtiers and merchants; the royal
office, the duties of the king and the divine origin of
kingship; and the place of the church in the Norwegian
state.</p>

<p class='c010'>In one of his earlier chapters the author enumerates
the chief subjects of a scientific character that ought
to be studied by every one who wishes to become a successful
merchant. These are the great luminaries of the
sky, the motions and the paths of the heavenly bodies,
the divisions of time and the changes that bring the
seasons, the cardinal points of the compass, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>tides and currents of the ocean.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> In discussing these
matters he is naturally led to a statement as to the shape
of the earth. All through the middle ages there were
thinkers who accepted the teachings of the classical
astronomers who had taught that the earth is round
like a sphere; but this belief was by no means general.
Bede for one appears to have been convinced that the
earth is of a spherical shape, though he explains that,
because of mountains which rise high above the surface,
it cannot be perfectly round.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Alexander Neckam, an
English scientist who wrote two generations before the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> was composed, states in his <i>Praise of
Divine Wisdom</i> that “the ancients have ventured to
believe that the earth is round, though mountains rise
high above its surface.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Neckam’s own ideas on this
point are quite confused and he remains discreetly non-committal.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if the earth is a globe, there is every reason to believe
in the existence of antipodes; and if there are antipodes,
all cannot behold Christ coming in the clouds
on the final day. To the medieval theologians, at least
to the larger number of them, this argument disposed
effectually of the Ptolemaic theory. Job does indeed say
that God “hangeth the earth upon nothing,”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and
this passage might point to a spherical form; but then
the Psalmist affirms that He “stretched out the earth
above the waters,”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and this statement would indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>that the inhabited part of the earth is an island floating
upon the waters of the great Ocean, by which it is also
surrounded. This belief was generally maintained in
the earlier centuries of the classical world, and it had
wide acceptance in the middle ages. There were also
those who held that beyond and around the outer Ocean
is a great girdle of fire. It is likely, however, that many
believed with Isidore of Seville that it is useless to speculate
on subjects of this sort. “Whether it [the earth]
is supported by the density of the air, or whether it is
spread out upon the waters ... or how the yielding air
can support such a vast mass as the earth, whether such
an immense weight can be upheld by the waters without
being submerged, or how the earth maintains its balance
... these matters it is not permitted any mortal to
know and they are not for us to discuss.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There can be no doubt that the author of the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> believed in the Ptolemaic theory of a spherical
earth. In speaking of our planet he uses the term <i>jarðarbollr</i>,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
earth-sphere. In an effort to explain why some
countries are hotter than others, he suggests an experiment
with an apple. It is not clear how this can shed
much light on the problem, but the author boldly states
the point to be illustrated: “From this you may infer
that the earth-circle is round like a ball.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Toward the close of the medieval period there were
certain thinkers who attempted to reconcile the spherical
theory with the belief that the inhabited part of the
earth is an island. These appear to have believed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the earth is a globe partly submerged in a larger sphere
composed of water.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The visible parts of the earth would
rise above the surrounding ocean like a huge island, and
the Biblical passages which had caused so much difficulty
could thus be interpreted in accord with apparent
facts. It is quite clear that the author of the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> held no such theory. In a poetic description of
how the eight winds form their covenants of friendship
at the approach of spring, he tells us that “at midnight
the north wind goes forth to meet the coursing sun and
leads him through rocky deserts toward the sparse-built
shores.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The author, therefore, seems to believe
that the earth is a sphere, that there are lands on the
opposite side of the earth, and that these lands are inhabited.
He also understands that the regions that lie
beneath the midnight course of the sun in spring and
summer must be thinly populated, as the sun’s path on
the opposite side of the earth during the season of
lengthening days is constantly approaching nearer the
pole.</p>

<p class='c010'>But while the author seems to accept the Ptolemaic
theory of the universe, he is not able to divest his mind
entirely of current geographical notions. There can be
no doubt that he believed in the encircling outer ocean,
and it is barely possible that he also looked with favor
on the belief that the whole was encompassed by a girdle
of fire. On this point, however, we cannot be sure: he
mentions the belief merely as one that is current, not as
one accepted by himself.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>It was commonly held in the middle ages that the
earth is divided into five zones, only two of which may
be inhabited. This was a theory advanced by a Greek
scientist in the fifth century before our era,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and was
given currency in medieval times chiefly, perhaps,
through the works of Macrobius.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> At first these zones
were conceived as belts drawn across the heavens; later
they came to be considered as divisions of the earth’s
surface. It will be noted that our author uses the older
terminology and speaks of the zones as belts on the
heaven;<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a> it may be inferred, therefore, that he derived
his information from one of the earlier Latin treatises
on the nature of the universe.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> For two thousand years
it was believed that human life could not exist in the
polar and torrid zones. Even as late as the fifteenth
century European navigators had great fear of travel
into the torrid zone, where the heat was thought to
grow more intense as one traveled south, until a point
might be reached where water in the sea would boil.
The author of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> seems to doubt all this.
He regards the polar zones as generally uninhabitable;
still, he is sure that Greenland lies within the arctic
zone; and yet, Greenland “has beautiful sunshine and
is said to have a rather pleasant climate.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a> He sees
quite clearly that the physical nature of a country may
have much to do with climatic conditions. The cold of
Iceland he ascribes in great part to its position near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Greenland: “for it is to be expected that severe cold
would come thence, since Greenland is ice-clad beyond
all other lands.”<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> He conceives the possibility that the
south temperate zone is inhabited. “And if people live as
near the cold belt on the southern side as the Greenlanders
do on the northern, I firmly believe that the
north wind blows as warm to them as the south wind
to us. For they must look north to see the midday and
the sun’s whole course, just as we, who dwell north of
the sun, must look to the south.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>On the questions of time and its divisions the author
of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> seems to have had nearly all the
information that the age possessed. He divides the
period of day and night into two “days” (<i>dægr</i>) of
twelve hours each. Each hour is again divided into
smaller hours called <i>ostenta</i> in Latin.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Any division
below the minute he apparently does not know. The
length of the year he fixes at 365 days and six hours,
every fourth year these additional hours make twenty-four
and we have leap year.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> The waxing and waning of
the moon and the tidal changes in the ocean are also
reckoned with fair accuracy.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Medieval scientists found these movements in the
ocean a great mystery. Some ascribed the tides to the
influence of the moon;<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> others believed that they were
caused by the collision of the waters of two arms of the
ocean, an eastern arm and a western; still others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>imagined that somewhere there were “certain cavern-like
abysses, which now swallow up the water, and now
spew it forth again.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a> The author of the <i>Speculum</i> has
no doubts on the subject: he believes that the tides are
due to the waxing and waning of the moon.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In his discussion of the volcanic fires of Iceland he
shows that on this subject he was completely under the
influence of medieval conceptions. He has heard that
Gregory the Great believed that the volcanic eruptions
in Sicily have their origins in the infernal regions. Our
author is inclined to question, however, that there is
anything supernatural about the eruptions of Mount
Etna; but he is quite sure that the volcanic fires of Iceland
rise from the places of pain. The fires of Sicily are
living fires, inasmuch as they devour living materials,
such as wood and earth; those of Iceland, on the other
hand, consume nothing living but only dead matter
like rock. And he therefore concludes that these fires
must have their origin in the realms of death.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The author has a suspicion that earthquakes may be
due to volcanic action, but he offers another explanation,
though he does not give it as his own belief. Down
in the bowels of the earth there is probably a large number
of caverns and empty passages. “At times it may
happen that these passages and cavities will be so completely
packed with air either by the winds or by the
power of the roaring breakers, that the pressure of the
blast cannot be confined, and this may be the origin of
those great earthquakes that occur in that country.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>In this theory there is nothing new or original: the belief
that the earth is of a spongy constitution and that
earthquakes are caused by air currents is a very old one,
which can be followed back through the writings of
Alexander Neckam,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> the Venerable Bede,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a> and others,
at least as far as to Isidore.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The elder Pliny, who wrote
his <i>Natural History</i> in the first century of the Christian
era, seems to have held similar views: “I believe there
can be no doubt that the winds are the cause of earthquakes.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The chapters that deal with the northern lights are
interesting because they seem to imply that these lights
were not visible in those parts of Norway where the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> was written. The editors of the Christiania
edition of this work call attention to the fact that
there have been periods when these phenomena were
less prominent, and suggest that there may have been
such a period in the thirteenth century.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a> The author
discusses these lights as one of the wonders of Greenland,
and the natural inference is that they were not
known in Norway. But it is also true that he speaks of
whales as if they were limited to the seas about Iceland
and Greenland, which is manifestly incorrect. It is
likely that the author merely wishes to emphasize the
fact that the northern lights appear with greater frequency
and in greater brilliance in Greenland than anywhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>in Norway. He gives three theories to account
for these phenomena: some ascribe them to a girdle of
fire which encircles the earth beyond the outer ocean;
others hold that the lights are merely rays of the sun
which find their way past the edges of the earth while
the sun is coursing underneath; but his own belief is
that frost and cold have attained to such a power in the
Arctic that they are able to put forth light.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a> In his
opinion cold is a positive force as much as heat or any
other form of energy. To the men of the author’s time
there was nothing strange in this belief: it seems to
have been held by many even before the thirteenth
century that ice could under certain conditions produce
heat and even burn.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Among the author’s scientific notions very little that
is really original can be found. It is Riant’s belief that
he drew to some extent from Oriental sources, the lore
of the East having come into the North as the spoil of
crusaders or as the acquisitions of Norwegian pilgrims.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
It may be doubted, however, whether the Saracenic
contribution is a real one: almost everything that the
author of the <i>Speculum Regale</i> presents as his belief can
be found in the Latin scientific manuals of the middle
ages. He alludes to the writings of Isidore of Seville, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>there can be little doubt that he was acquainted with
the ideas of the great Spaniard, though he does not accept
them all. His ideas as to the shape of the earth and
the probable causes of earthquakes may have been derived
from the writings of the Venerable Bede, or from
one of his numerous followers. The divisions of time are
discussed in many of the scientific treatises of the middle
ages, but the division of the hour into sixtieths called
<i>ostenta</i> is probably not found in any manual written before
the ninth century; so far as the writer has been able
to determine, <i>ostenta</i>, meaning minutes, first appears in
the works of Rabanus Maurus.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The discussion of these scientific notions has its chief
value in showing to what extent the Norwegians of the
thirteenth century were acquainted with the best theories
of the age as to the great facts of the universe. The
author’s own contribution to the scientific learning of
his time lies almost exclusively in the field of geography.
“Beyond comparison the most important geographical
writer of the medieval North,” says Dr. Nansen, “and
at the same time one of the first in the whole of medieval
Europe, was the unknown author who wrote the <i>King’s
Mirror</i>.... If one turns from contemporary or earlier
European geographical literature, with all its superstition
and obscurity, to this masterly work, the difference
is very striking.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a> This is doubtless due to the fact that
our author was not a cloistered monk who was content
to copy the ideas and expressions of his predecessors with
such changes as would satisfy a theological mind, but a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>man who had been active in the secular world and was
anxious to get at real facts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the chapters devoted to scientific lore the
author has introduced several which are ostensibly intended
to serve the purpose of entertainment; the author
seems to fear that the interest of his readers is likely
to flag, if the dry recital of physical facts is continued
unbroken. It is in these chapters, which profess to deal
with the marvels of Norway, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland,
and the Arctic seas, that he introduces his geographical
data. In the description of Greenland are
included such important and practical subjects as the
general character of the land, the great ice fields, the
products of the country, wild animals, and a few facts
from the economic life of the people. In the chapters on
Iceland the author limits himself to certain physical
features, such as glaciers, geysers, mineral springs, volcanoes,
and earthquakes. He also gives a “description
of the animal world of the northern seas to which there
is no parallel in the earlier literature of the world.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a> He
enumerates twenty-one different species of whales<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and
describes several of them with some fulness. He mentions
and describes six varieties of seals<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> and also gives
a description of the walrus. The marvelous element is
represented by detailed accounts of the “sea-hedges”
(probably sea quakes) on the coasts of Greenland, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>merman, the mermaid, and the kraken.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a> But on the
whole these chapters give evidence of careful, discriminating
observation and a desire to give accurate knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>For all but the two chapters on Ireland the sources of
the author’s geographical information are evidently the
tales of travelers and his own personal experiences; of
literary sources there is no trace. The account of the
marvels of Ireland, however, gives rise to certain problems.
It may be that the Norwegian geographer based
these chapters on literary sources that are still extant,
or he may have had access to writings which have since
disappeared. It is also possible that some of the information
was contributed by travelers who sailed the
western seas and had sojourned on the “western isles;”
for it must be remembered that Norway still had colonies
as far south as the Isle of Man, and that Norsemen
were still living in Ireland, though under English rule.
When Hakon IV made his expedition into these regions
in 1263, some of these Norwegian colonists in Ireland
sought his aid in the hope that English rule might be
overthrown.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It has long been known that many of the tales of
Irish wonders and miracles that are recounted in the
<i>Speculum Regale</i> are also told in the <i>Topographia Hibernica</i>
by Giraldus Cambrensis. The famous Welshman
wrote his work several decades before the <i>King’s Mirror</i>
was composed; and it is not impossible that the author
of the latter had access to the “Irish Topography.”
Moreover, the <i>Speculum Regale</i> and the <i>Topographia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Hibernica</i> have certain common features which correspond
so closely that literary kinship seems quite probable.
The resemblances, however, are not so much in the
details as in the plan and the viewpoint. In the second
book of his “Topography,” Giraldus recounts “first
those things that nature has planted in the land itself;”
and next “those things that have been miraculously
performed through the merits of the saints.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The author
of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> has adopted a similar grouping.
After having discussed some of the wonders of the
island he continues: “There still remain certain things
that may be thought marvelous; these, however, are
not native to the land but have originated in the miraculous
powers of holy men.”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a> This correspondence in the
general plan is too remarkable to be wholly accidental;
at least it should lead us to look for other resemblances
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his general description of Ireland the author of
the Norwegian work calls attention to the excellence of
the land and its temperate climate: “for all through the
winter the cattle find their feed in the open.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Giraldus
informs us that grass grows in winter as well as in summer,
and he adds: “therefore they are accustomed neither
to cut hay for fodder nor to provide stables for the
cattle.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Both writers emphasize the fact that grapes
do not grow on the island. In both writings attention is
called to the sacred character of the Irish soil, which
makes it impossible for reptiles and venomous animals
to live on the land, though Giraldus has his doubts as
to the supernatural phase of the matter. Both writers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>add that if sand or dust is brought from Ireland to
another country and scattered about a reptile, it will
perish.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Both characterize the Irish people as savage
and murderous, but they also call attention to their
kind treatment of holy men, of whom the island has
always had many.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a> In fact, every statement in the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> as to the nature of the land and the
character of the inhabitants can be duplicated in Giraldus’
description of Ireland, except, perhaps, the single
observation that the Irish people, because of the mildness
of the climate, often wear no clothes.</p>

<p class='c010'>But even if Giraldus’ work is to be regarded as one of
the sources which the Norwegian author may have used
in writing his chapters on the Irish mirabilia, it cannot
have been the only or even the principal source. The
account of these marvels in the <i>King’s Mirror</i> does not
wholly agree with that of the Welshman’s work. In some
instances the wonders are told with details that are
wanting in the earlier narrative. Frequently, too, the
Norwegian version is more explicit as to localities and
gives proper names where Giraldus has none. It also
records marvels and miracles which are not found in the
<i>Topographia Hibernica</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In an edition of the <i>Irish Nennius</i> the editor has
added as an appendix a brief account of the “Wonders
of Ireland,” many of the tales of which have interesting
parallels in the <i>King’s Mirror</i>. There is also a medieval
poem on the same theme<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a> which contains allusions to
much that the Norwegian author has recorded with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>greater fulness. Neither of these works, however, can
have been the source from which the chapters on Ireland
in the <i>Speculum Regale</i> have been derived.</p>

<p class='c010'>The learned editors of the Christiania edition of the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> reached the conclusion that the author
did not draw from any literary source but derived his
information from current tales and other oral accounts.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
This is also the opinion of Dr. Kuno Meyer, the eminent
student of Celtic philology.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Dr. Meyer bases his
belief on the form of the Irish proper names. As written
in the <i>Speculum Regale</i> they can not have been copied,
as the spelling is not normally Irish; he believes, therefore,
that they show an effort on the author’s part to
reproduce phonetically these names as he heard them
spoken. But this theory ignores the fact that in writing
them the author employs combinations of consonants
which are unusual to say the least. Combinations of <i>ch</i>
and <i>gh</i> are used in writing nearly all the Irish proper
names that occur in the <i>King’s Mirror</i> and the <i>gh</i>-combination
is found nowhere else in the work.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a> It was
probably coming into the language in the century to
which the work is credited, but the author uses it only
as indicated above. It seems likely, therefore, that he
had access to a written source, though it is also likely
that he did not have this account before him when the
writing was actually done. As has already been stated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the author seems to have written largely from memory,
and his memory is not always accurate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having discussed the subjects which he considers of
chief importance for the education of a merchant, the
learned father proceeds to describe the king’s household
and its organization, the manners which one should
observe at court, and the business that is likely to come
before a king. For the part which deals with the royal
court, it is probable that no literary sources were used.
The author evidently wrote from long experience in the
king’s retinue; he is not discussing an ideal organization
but the king’s household as it was in Bergen and Trondhjem
in his own day. If he drew from any written description
of courtly manners, it may have been from
some book like Petrus Alfonsus’ <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i>,
which has already been mentioned<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and which seems
to have had a wide circulation throughout western
Europe in the later middle ages.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chapters that are devoted to the discussion of the
duties and activities of the king’s guardsmen, to the
manners and customs which should rule in the king’s
garth, and to the ethical ideas on which these were
largely based are of great interest to the student of medieval
culture. They reveal a progress in the direction
of refined life and polished manners, which one should
scarcely expect to find in the Northern lands. The development
of courtesy and refined manners may have
been accelerated by the new literature which was coming
into Scandinavia from France and Germany, a
literature that dealt so largely with the doings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>knights and kings;<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a> but it was probably not so much a
matter of bookish instruction as of direct imitation. The
Northmen, though they lived far from the great centers
of culture, were always in close touch with the rest of
the world. In the earlier centuries the viking sailed his
dreaded craft wherever there was wealth and plunder
and civilized life. After him and often as his companion
came the merchant who brought away new ideas along
with other desirable wares. After a time Christianity
was introduced from the southlands, and the pilgrim
and the crusader took the place of the heathen pirate.
And all these classes helped to reshape the life of courtesy
in the Northern countries.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is difficult to overestimate the influence of the
crusader as a pioneer of Christian culture in Scandinavia,
but it seems possible that the pilgrim was even more
important in this respect. It was no doubt largely
through his journeys that German influences began to
be felt in the Scandinavian lands, though it is possible
that the wide activities of the Hanseatic merchants
should also be credited with some importance for the
spread of Teutonic culture. It is told in the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> that a new mode of dressing the hair and the
beard had been introduced from Germany since the
author had retired from the royal court.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> It is significant
that the routes usually followed by Norwegian
pilgrims who sought the Eternal City and the holy
places in the Orient ran through German lands. As a
rule the pilgrims traveled through Jutland, Holstein,
and the Old Saxon territories and reached the Rhine at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Mainz. It was also possible to take a more easterly
route, and sometimes the travelers would go by sea to
the Low Countries and thence southward past Utrecht
and Cologne; but all these three routes converged at
Mainz, whence the journey led up the Rhine and across
the Alps. It will be noted that a long stretch of the journey
from Norway to Rome would lead through the
German kingdom. Concerning the people of the Old
Saxon or German lands an Icelandic scribe makes the
following significant remark: “In that country the
people are more polished and courteous than in most
places and the Northmen imitate their customs quite
generally.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The cultural influences which followed in the wake of
the returning crusaders were no doubt largely of Frankish
origin. As a rule the crusading expeditions followed
the sea route along the coasts of France and the Spanish
peninsula; thus the Northern warriors came in contact
with French ideas and customs in the Frankish homeland
as well as in the Christian armies, which were
largely made up of enthusiastic and venturesome
knights from Frankland. The author of the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> urges his son to learn Latin and French, “for
these idioms are most widely used.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>One of the reasons why the son wishes to master the
mercantile profession is that he desires to travel and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>learn the customs of other lands.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a> In the thirteenth
century the Norwegian trade still seems to have been
largely with England and the other parts of the British
Isles. It is also important to remember that the Norwegian
church was a daughter of the church of England,
and that occasionally English churchmen were elevated
to high office in the Norwegian establishment. It is
likely that Master William, who was Hakon IV’s chaplain,
was an Englishman; at least he bore an English
name.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Information as to foreign civilization and the rules of
courteous behavior could also pass from land to land
and from court to court with the diplomatic missions
of the time. The wise father states that envoys who
come and go are careful to observe the manners that
obtain at the courts to which they are sent.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Frequent
embassies must have passed between the capitals of
England and Norway in the thirteenth century. It is
recorded that both King John and his son Henry III received
envoys from the king of Norway, and that they
brought very acceptable gifts, such as hawks and elks,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
especially the former: in twelve different years Hakon
IV sent hawks to the English king.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Embassies also came quite frequently from the imperial
court in Germany. It was during the reign of
Hakon IV that the Hohenstaufens were waging their
last fight with the papacy, and both sides in the conflict
seemed anxious to secure the friendship of the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Norwegian king. The Saga of Hakon relates that early
in the king’s reign “missions began between the emperor
and King Hakon.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a> In 1241, “when King Hakon
came to the King’s Crag, that man came to him whose
name was Matthew, sent from the emperor Frederick
with many noble gifts. Along with him came from
abroad five Bluemen (negroes).”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Just how acceptable
such a gift would be in medieval Norway the chronicler
does not state. There can be no doubt, however, that
Hakon returned the courtesy. The saga mentions several
men who were sent on diplomatic errands to the imperial
court. One of these emissaries had to go as far as Sicily,
“and the emperor received him well.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The relationship with the other Scandinavian kingdoms
was more direct. The <i>King’s Mirror</i> states that
occasionally kings find it necessary to meet in conference
for the discussion of common problems; and that on
such occasions the members of the various retinues note
carefully the customs and manners of the other groups.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
These meetings were usually held at some point near
the mouth of the Göta River, where the boundaries of
the three kingdoms touched a common point. In 1254
such a meeting was held at which Hakon of Norway,
Christopher of Denmark, and the great Earl Birger
of Sweden were in attendance with their respective
retinues.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The kings of the North were not limited, however, in
their diplomatic intercourse to the neighboring monarchies;
their ambassadors went out to the remotest parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of Europe and even to Africa. Valdemar the Victorious,
in his day one of the greatest rulers in Christendom,
married as his first wife Dragomir, a Bohemian princess
who brought the Dagmar name into Denmark, and
took as his second consort Berengaria of Portugal,
Queen Bengjerd, whose lofty pride is enshrined in the
Danish ballads of the age. Hakon IV married the daughter
of his restless rival, Duke Skule; but his daughter
Christina was sought in marriage by a prince in far-away
Spain. The luckless princess was sent to Castile
and was married at Valladolid to a son of Alfonso the
Wise.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a> Louis IX of France was anxious to enlist the
support of the Norwegian king for his crusading ventures
and sent the noted English historian Matthew
Paris to present the matter to King Hakon.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a> The mission,
however, was without results. Norwegian diplomacy
was concerned even with the courts of the infidel:
in 1262 an embassy was sent to the Mohammedan sultan
of Tunis “with many falcons and those other things
which were there hard to get. And when they got out
the Soldan received them well, and they stayed there
long that winter.”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>An important event of the diplomatic type was the
coming of Cardinal William of Sabina as papal legate
to crown King Hakon. The coronation ceremony was
performed in Bergen, July 29, 1247. At the coronation
banquet the cardinal made a speech in which, as the
Saga of Hakon reports his remarks, he called particular
attention to the polished manners of the Northmen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“It was told me that I would here see few men; but
even though I saw some, they would be liker to beasts
in their behaviour than to men; but now I see here a
countless multitude of the folk of this land, and, as it
seems to me, with good behaviour.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a> If the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> gives a correct statement of what was counted
good manners and proper conduct at the court of Hakon
IV, the cardinal’s praise is none too strong.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a part of his discussion of the duties and activities
of the king’s henchmen, the author describes the military
methods of the age, arms and armour, military
engines and devices used in offensive and defensive
warfare, and other necessary equipment.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a> He also discusses
the ethics of the military profession to some extent.
This part of the work has been made the subject of
a detailed study by Captain Otto Blom of the Danish
artillery, who has tried to fix a date for the composition
of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> on the basis of these materials.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c015'><sup>[81]</sup></a> It
is not likely, however, that the work describes the military
art of the North; such an elaborate system of equipment
and such a variety of military engines and devices
the Norwegians probably never knew at any time in
the middle ages. It is the military art of Europe which
the author describes, especially the war machinery of the
crusades. One should not be surprised to find that he
had knowledge of the devices which were employed by
the Christian hosts in their warfare against the infidel
in the Orient. The crusades attracted the Norwegian
warriors and they took a part in them almost from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>beginning. The fifth crusade began in 1217, the year of
Hakon IV’s accession to the kingship. Several Norwegian
chiefs with their followers joined this movement,
some marching by land through Germany and Hungary,
while others took the sea route. One is tempted to believe
that the author was himself a crusader, but it is
also possible that he got his information as to the military
art of the south and east from warriors who returned
from those lands.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the subject of proper behavior and good breeding
the author passes to a discussion of evil conduct and
its effect on the welfare of the kingdom. Many causes,
he tells us, may combine to bring calamities upon a
land, and if the evils continue any length of time, the
realm will be ruined.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a> There may come dearth upon the
fields and the fishing grounds near the shores; plagues
may carry away cattle, and the huntsman may find a
scarcity of game; but worst of all is the dearth which
sometimes comes upon the intellects and the moral
nature of men. As a prolific source of calamities of the
last sort, the author mentions the institution of joint
kingship, the evils of which he discusses at some length.
His chapter on this subject is an epitome of Norwegian
history in the twelfth century when joint kingship was
the rule.</p>

<p class='c010'>According to the laws of medieval Norway before the
thirteenth century, the national kingship was the king’s
allodial possession and was inherited by his sons at his
death. All his sons were legal heirs, those of illegitimate
birth as well as those who were born in wedlock. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>there was more than one heir, the kingship was held
jointly, all the claimants receiving the royal title and
permission to maintain each his own household. Usually
a part of the realm was assigned to each; but it was the
administration, and not the kingdom itself, which was
thus divided. It is readily seen that such a system would
offer unusual opportunities for pretenders; and at least
three times in one hundred years men whose princely
rights were at best of a doubtful character mounted
the Norwegian throne. It is an interesting fact that two
of these, the strenuous Sverre and the wise Hakon IV,
must be counted among the strongest, ablest, and most
attractive kings in the history of Norway.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though there had been instances of joint rule before
the twelfth century, the history of that unfortunate
form of administration properly begins with the death
of Magnus Bareleg on an Irish battlefield in 1103.
Three illegitimate sons, the oldest being only fourteen
years of age, succeeded to the royal title. One of these
was the famous Sigurd Jerusalemfarer, who took part
in the later stages of the first crusade. About twenty
years after King Magnus’ death, a young Irishman,
Harold Gilchrist by name, appeared at the Norwegian
court and claimed royal rights as a son of the fallen
king. King Sigurd forced him to prove his birthright by
an appeal to the ordeal, but the Irishman walked unhurt
over the hot plowshares. Harold became king in
1130 as joint ruler with Sigurd’s son Magnus, later
called “the Blind.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Three of his sons succeeded to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>kingship in 1136. During the next century several pretenders
appeared and civil war became almost the normal
state of the country. Between 1103 and 1217 fifteen
princes were honored with the royal title; eleven of
these were minors. The period closed with the defeat
and death of King Hakon’s father-in-law, the pretender
Skule, in 1240.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the history of these hundred years and more of
joint kingship, of pretenders, of minorities, and of civil
war, which the author of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> had in mind
when he wrote his gloomy chapter on the calamities that
may befall a state. Perhaps he was thinking more especially
of the unnatural conflict between King Hakon
and Duke Skule,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c015'><sup>[84]</sup></a> which was fought out in 1240, and the
memory of which was still fresh at the time when the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> was being written.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the king and his duties as ruler and judge the
<i>Speculum Regale</i> has much to say; but as these matters
offer no problems that call for discussion, it will not be
necessary to examine them in detail. Wholly different
is the case of the king’s relation to the church, of the
position of the church in the state, of the divine origin
of kingship, of the fulness of the royal authority. On
these questions the author’s opinions and arguments are
of great importance: in the history of the theory of kingship
by the grace of God and divine right and of absolute
monarchy, the <i>Speculum Regale</i> is an important
landmark.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the discussion of the origin and powers of the royal
office, the <i>King’s Mirror</i> again shows unmistakably the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>influence of events in the preceding century of Norwegian
history. So long as the church of Norway was
under the supervision of foreign archbishops, first the
metropolitan of distant Hamburg and later the archbishop
of the Danish (now Swedish) see of Lund, there
was little likelihood of any serious clash between the
rival powers of church and state. But when, in 1152, an
archiepiscopal see was established at Nidaros (Trondhjem)
trouble broke out at once. The wave of enthusiasm
for a powerful and independent church, which had
developed such vigor in the days of Gregory VII, was
still rising high. Able men were appointed to the new
metropolitan office and the Norwegian church very soon
put forth the usual demands of the time: separate ecclesiastical
courts and immunity from anything that looked
like taxation or forced contribution to the state. At first
these claims had no reality in fact, as the kings would
not allow them; but in 1163<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a> an opportunity came for
the church to make its demands effective. In that year
a victorious faction asked for the coronation of a new
king whose claims to the throne came through his
mother only. The pretender was a mere child and the
actual power was in the hands of his capable and ambitious
father, Erling Skakke. The imperious archbishop
Eystein agreed to consecrate the boy king if he would
consent to become the vassal of Saint Olaf, or, in other
words, of the archbishop of Nidaros. Erling acquiesced
and young Magnus was duly crowned. It was further
stipulated that in future cases of disputed succession the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>final decision should rest with the bishops.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a> The state
was formally made subject to the church. It must be
noted, however, that it was not the head of Catholic
Christendom who made these claims, but the chief
prelate of the national Norwegian church. The theory
was doubtless this, that if the pope is superior to the
emperor, the archbishop is superior to the king.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new arrangement did not long remain unchallenged.
In 1177 the opposition to the ecclesiastical
faction found a leader in Sverre, called Sigurdsson, an
adventurer from the Faroe Islands, who pretended to
be a grandson of Harold Gilchrist, though the probabilities
are that his father was one Unas, a native of the
Faroes.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a> Sverre’s followers were known as Birchshanks,
because they had been reduced to such straits that they
had to bind birch bark around their legs. The faction in
control of the government was called the Croziermen
and was composed of the higher clergy with an important
following among the aristocracy. Sverre’s fight was,
therefore, not against King Magnus alone but against
the Guelph party of Norway. For half a century there
was intermittent civil warfare between the supporters
of an independent and vigorous kingship on the one side
and the partisans of clerical control on the other. King
Sverre’s great service to Norway was that he broke the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>chain of ecclesiastical domination. The conflict was long
and bitter and the great king died while it was still on;
but when it ended the cause of the Croziermen was lost.
The church attained to great power in the Norwegian
state, but it never gained complete domination.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sverre was a man of great intellectual strength; he
was a born leader of men, a capable warrior, and a resourceful
captain. When it began to look as if victory
would crown his efforts, the archbishop fled to England
and from his refuge in Saint Edmundsbury excommunicated
the king. But exile is irksome to an ambitious man,
and after a time the fiery prelate returned to Norway
and was reconciled to the strenuous ruler. Eystein’s
successor, however, took up the fight once more; and
when Sverre made Norway too uncomfortable for him,
he fled to Denmark and excommunicated his royal opponent.
A few years later, Innocent III, who had just
ascended the papal throne, also excommunicated Sverre,
and threatened the kingdom with an interdict.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a> But
the papal weapons had little effect in the far North; the
king forced priests and prelates to remain loyal and to
continue in their duties. No doubt they obeyed the excommunicated
ruler with great reluctance and much
misgiving; but no other course was possible, for the
nation was with the king.</p>

<p class='c010'>The militant Faroese was a man with strong literary
interests; he was educated for the priesthood and it is
believed that he had actually taken orders. He was eloquent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>in speech, but he realized the power of the written
as well as of the spoken word. It is a fact worth noting
that among the Northmen of the thirteenth century
learning was not confined to the clergy. While the author
of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> urges the prospective merchant to
learn Latin and French, he also warns him not to neglect
his mother tongue. King Sverre replied to the ecclesiastical
decrees with a manifesto in the Norwegian language
in which he stated his position and his claims for
the royal office. This pamphlet, which is commonly
known as “An Address against the Bishops,” was issued
about 1199 and was sent to all the shire courts to be
read to the freemen. It was a cleverly written document
and seems to have been very effective. In spite of the
fact that the king was under the ban, the masses remained
loyal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between the political theory of the <i>Address</i> and the
ideas of kingship expressed in the <i>King’s Mirror</i> there
is an agreement which can hardly be accidental. It is
more likely that we have in this case literary kinship of
the first degree. It has been thought that King Sverre
may have prepared his manifesto himself, but this is
scarcely probable. Some one of his court, however, must
have composed it, perhaps some clerk in the royal scriptorium,
for the ideas developed in the document are
clearly those of the king. It has also been suggested that
the <i>Address</i> and the <i>Speculum Regale</i> may have been
written by the same hand;<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a> but the only evidence in
support of such a conclusion is this agreement of political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>ideas, which may have originated in a careful study of
the earlier document by the author of the later work.</p>

<p class='c010'>King Sverre’s <i>Address</i> begins with a violent attack on
the higher clergy: the bishops have brought sorrow upon
the land and confusion into holy church. This deplorable
condition is ascribed chiefly to a reckless use of the
power of excommunication. In this connection the king
is careful to absolve the pope from all guilt: his unfortunate
deeds were due to ignorance and to false representations
on the part of the bishops. It is next argued that
excommunication is valid only when the sentence of
anathema is just; an unjust sentence is not only invalid
but it recoils upon the head of him who is the author of
the anathema. In support of this contention the author
of the manifesto quotes the opinions of such eminent
fathers as Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine, Pope Gregory
the Great, and other authorities on canon law. It will
be remembered that the king himself was under the ban
at the time. The author argues further that his view is
supported by reason as well as by the law of the church.
Bishops have been appointed shepherds of the flocks of
God; they are to watch over them, not drive them away
into the jaws of the wolves. But if a bishop excommunicates
one who is without guilt, he consigns him to hell;
and if his decree is effective, he destroys one of God’s
sheep.</p>

<p class='c010'>From this subject the <i>Address</i> passes to the nature of
the royal office. “So great a number of examples show
clearly that the salvation of a man’s soul is at stake if
he does not observe complete loyalty, kingly worship,
and a right obedience; for kingly rule is created by God’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>command and not by the ordinance of man, and no man
can obtain royal authority except by divine dispensation.”
The king is not a secular ruler only, he also has
holy church in his power and keeping. It is his right and
duty to appoint church officials, and the churchmen
owe him absolute loyalty the same as his other subjects.
Christ pointed out the duty of church officials quite
clearly when he paid tribute to his earthly ruler, one
who was, moreover, a heathen.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It will be seen that the <i>Address</i> puts forth four claims
of far-reaching importance: kingship is of divine origin
and the king rules by the grace of God; the power of
royalty extends to the church as well as to the state and
includes the power to appoint the rulers of the church;
disloyalty to the king is a mortal sin; an unjust sentence
of excommunication is invalid and injures him only who
publishes the anathema. On all these points the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> is in complete agreement with Sverre’s manifesto.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the course of the dialog in the <i>Speculum Regale</i> the
son requests his father to take up and discuss the office
and business of the king; for, says he, “he is so highly
honored and exalted upon earth that all must bend
and bow before him as before God.”<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c015'><sup>[91]</sup></a> The father accounts
for the power and dignity of kingship in this
way: men bow before the king as before God, because
he represents the exalted authority of God; he bears
God’s own name and occupies the highest judgment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>seat upon earth; consequently, when one honors a king,
it is as if he honors God himself, because of the title that
he has from God.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c015'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The author evidently realizes that statements of this
sort will not be accepted without further argument, and
he naturally proceeds to give his doctrine a basis in
Biblical history. The reverence due kingship is fully
illustrated with episodes in the career of David. So long
as God permitted King Saul to live, David would do
nothing to deprive him of his office; for Saul was also
the Lord’s anointed. He took swift revenge upon the
man who came to his camp pretending that he had slain
Saul; for he had sinned against God in bearing arms
against His anointed. He also calls attention to Saint
Peter’s injunction: “Fear God and honor your king;”
and adds that it is “almost as if he had literally said
that he who does not show perfect honor to the king
does not fear God.”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c015'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>To emphasize his contention that kingship is of divine
origin, the author cites the example of Christ. The miracle
of the fish in whose mouth the tribute money was
found is referred to in the <i>Address</i> as well as in the <i>King’s
Mirror</i>. Peter was to examine the first fish, not the
second or the third. In the same way, and here the argument
is characteristically medieval, “every man should
in all things first honor the king and the royal dignity;
for God Himself calls the king His anointed.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>But, objects the son, how could Christ who is himself
the lord of heaven and earth be willing to submit to
an earthly authority? To this the father replies that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Christ came to earth as a guest and did not wish to deprive
the divine institution of kingship of any honor or
dignity.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a> The author evidently deems it important to
establish this contention; for if Christ submitted to
Caesar as to a rightful authority, the church in opposing
secular rulers could scarcely claim to be following in the
footsteps of the Master.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems to be a safe conclusion that the doctrine of
the divine character of kingship as developed in the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> is derived from King Sverre’s <i>Address</i>,
unless it should be that the two have drawn from a common
source. There is nothing novel about Sverre’s ideas
except the form in which they are stated; fundamentally
they are a return to the original Norwegian theory of
kingship. The Norwegian kings of heathen times were
descendants of divine ancestors. They recognized the will
of the popular assemblies as a real limitation on their
own powers, but no religious authority could claim superiority
to the ruler. The king was indeed himself a
priest, a mediator between the gods and men. The
Christian kings for a century and a half had controlled
the church in a very real manner; they had appointed
bishops and had also on occasion removed them. The
claim of the archbishop to overlordship was therefore
distinctly an innovation. The king makes use of arguments
from the Bible to support his theory, not because
it was based on Scriptural truths, but because to a
Christian people these would prove the most convincing.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his statement of the fulness and majesty of the
royal power, the author of the <i>Speculum Regale</i> goes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>however, far beyond the author of the <i>Address</i>. So complete
is the king’s power, “that he may dispose as he
likes of the lives of all who live in his kingdom.”<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c015'><sup>[96]</sup></a> He
“owns the entire kingdom as well as all the people in it,
so that all the men who are in his kingdom owe him
service whenever his needs demand it.”<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a> These sentences
would indicate that the author’s position lies
close to the verge of absolutism. But Norwegian kingship
was anything but absolute; the king had certain
well-defined rights, but the people also had some part
in the government. Professor Ludvig Daae has put forth
the hypothesis that the author of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> was
acquainted with the governmental system of Frederick
II in his Italian kingdom, which he governed as an absolute
monarch.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a> There may be some truth in this for
there is no doubt that the character of Frederick’s
government was known to the Northmen; but it is also
possible that the theory of absolute monarchy had a
separate Norse origin, that the insistence on divine right
in the long fight with the church had driven the partisans
of monarchy far forward along the highway that
led to practical absolutism. Less than a generation after
the <i>King’s Mirror</i> was composed, the newer ideas of
kingship appear in the legislation of Magnus Lawmender.
Kings have received their authority from God, for
“God Himself deigns to call Himself by their name;”
and the preamble continues: “he is, indeed, in great
danger before God, who does not with perfect love and
reverence uphold them in the authority to which God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>has appointed them.”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c015'><sup>[99]</sup></a> This is the doctrine of the <i>Address</i>
as well as of the <i>Speculum</i>; the significant fact is
that the principle has now been introduced into the
constitution of the monarchy. It is possible that the
author of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> states an alien principle; but
it is more probable that he merely gives form to a belief
that had been growing among Northmen for some time.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the question of the validity of excommunication
the teachings of the <i>Speculum Regale</i> are in perfect accord
with those of the <i>Address</i>. The uncompromising
position and methods of Innocent III had given point
to an exceedingly practical question: was a Christian
permitted to obey a king who was under the ban of the
church? Generally the church held that obedience under
the circumstances would be sinful. The author of the
<i>Speculum</i> distinguishes closely, however, between just
and unjust sentences of excommunication. God has
established two houses upon earth, the house of the
altar and the house of the judgment seat.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a> There is,
therefore, a legitimate sphere of action for the bishop as
well as for the king. But an act is not necessarily righteous
because it emanates from high authority either in
the church or in the state. If the king pronounces an
unjust judgment, his act is murder; if a bishop excommunicates
a Christian without proper reasons, the ban
is of no effect, except that it reacts upon the offending
prelate himself.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>After the author has thus denied the right of the
church to use the sword of excommunication in certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>cases, there remains the question: has the king any superior
authority over the church? The answer is that
the king has such authority; and the author fortifies his
position by recalling the story how Solomon punished
Abiathar the high priest, or bishop as he is called in the
<i>King’s Mirror</i>. In reply to the young man’s inquiry
whether Solomon did right when he deprived Abiathar
of the high-priestly office, the father affirms that the
king acted properly and according to law. The king is
given a two-edged sword for the reason that he must
guard, not only his own house of judgment, but also the
house of the altar, which is ordinarily in the bishop’s
keeping. Abiathar had sinned in becoming a party to the
treasonable intrigues of Adonijah, who was plotting to
seize the throne of Israel while his father David was
still living. Inasmuch as the high priest had attempted
to deprive the Lord’s anointed of his royal rights, Solomon
would have been guiltless even if he had taken
Abiathar’s life. The author also calls attention to the
fact that Abiathar was elevated to the high-priestly
office by David himself.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>On the question of the king’s right to control episcopal
appointments the <i>King’s Mirror</i> is also in agreement
with the earlier <i>Address</i>. On the death of Archbishop
John, the <i>Address</i> tells us, “Inge appointed Eystein,
his own chaplain, to the archiepiscopal office<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c015'><sup>[103]</sup></a> ... without
consulting any cleric in Trondhjem, either the
canons or any one else; and he drove Bishop Paul from
the episcopal throne in Bergen and chose Nicholas
Petersson to be his successor.” Doubtless the philosopher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of the <i>King’s Mirror</i>, when he wrote of the fall of
Abiathar, was also thinking of the many Abiathars of
Norwegian history in the twelfth century, especially,
perhaps, of the bishops of Sverre’s reign, who had striven
so valiantly to rid the nation of its energetic king. There
can be no doubt, however, that he regarded the hierarchy
as inferior to the secular government. A bishop,
who unrighteously excommunicates a Norwegian king
and attempts in this way to render him impossible as a
ruler, forfeits not only his office but his life.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was another problem in the middle ages which
also involved the question of ecclesiastical authority as
opposed to secular jurisdiction, the right of sanctuary.
There can be no doubt that in the unsettled state of
medieval society it was well that there were places where
an accused might find security for a time at least; but
the right of sanctuary was much abused, too frequently
it served to shield the guilty. The <i>King’s Mirror</i> teaches
unequivocally that the right of sanctuary cannot be invoked
against the orders of the king. As usual the author
finds support for his position in the Scriptures. Joab fled
to God’s tabernacle and laid hold on the horns of the altar;
nevertheless, King Solomon ordered him to be slain, and
the command was carried out.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a> Solomon appears to
have reasoned in this wise: “It is my duty to carry out
the provisions of the sacred law, no matter where
the man happens to be whose case is to be determined.”
It was not his duty to remove Joab by force, for all just
decisions are God’s decisions and not the king’s; and
“God’s holy altar will not be defiled or desecrated by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Joab’s blood, for it will be shed in righteous punishment.”<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c015'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
And the author is careful to emphasize the fact
that God’s tabernacle was the only house in all the world
that was dedicated to Him, and must consequently have
had an even greater claim to sacredness than the churches
of the author’s own day, of which there was a vast
number.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c015'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There was a Norwegian Joab in the first half of the
thirteenth century, who, like the chieftain of old, plotted
against his rightful monarch and was finally slain within
the sacred precincts of an Augustinian convent. Skule,
King Hakon’s father-in-law, was a man of restless ambition,
who could not find complete satisfaction in the
titles of earl and duke, but stretched forth his hand to
seize the crown itself. In 1239 he assumed the royal
title, but a few months later (1240) his forces were surprised
in Nidaros by the king’s army, and the rebellion
came to a sudden end. Skule’s men fled to the churches;
his son Peter found refuge in one of the buildings belonging
to the monastery of Elgesæter, but was discovered
and slain. After a few days Duke Skule himself
sought security in the same monastery; but the angry
Birchshanks, in spite of the solemn warnings and
threatenings of the offended monks, slew the pretender
and burned the monastery.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c015'><sup>[107]</sup></a> This was an act of violence
which must have caused much trouble for the king’s
partisans, and it is most likely the act which the author
of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> had in his thoughts when he wrote
of the fate of Joab.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Writers on political philosophy usually begin their
specific discussion of the theory of divine right of kingship
when they come to the great political theorists of the
fourteenth century.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c015'><sup>[108]</sup></a> The most famous of these is Marsiglio
of Padua, who wrote his <i>Defensor Pacis</i> in 1324.
In this work he asserted that the emperor derived his
title and sovereignty from God and that his authority
was superior to that of the pope. Some years earlier
William Occam, an English scholar and philosopher,
made similar claims for the rights of the king of France.
Earlier still, perhaps in 1310, Dante had claimed divine
right for princes generally in his famous work <i>De Monarchia</i>.
Somewhat similar, though less precise, ideas
had been expressed by John of Paris in 1305. But nearly
two generations earlier the doctrine had been stated in
all its baldness and with all its implications by the author
of the <i>King’s Mirror</i>; and more than a century before
Dante wrote his work on “Monarchy” Sverre had
published his <i>Address</i> to the Norwegian people. So far
as the writer has been able to determine there is no
treatise on general medieval politics, at least no such
treatise written in English, which contains even an allusion
to these two significant works.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ethical ideas that are outlined in the <i>Speculum
Regale</i> are also of more than common interest. On most
points the learned father preaches the conventional
principles of the church with respect to right and wrong
conduct, and as a rule his precepts are such as have
stood the test of ages of experience. He emphasizes
honesty, fair dealing, careful attendance upon worship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and devotion to the church; he warns his son to shun
vice of every sort; he must also avoid gambling and
drinking to excess.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c015'><sup>[109]</sup></a> In some respects the author’s moral
code is Scandinavian rather than Christian: in the emphasis
that he places upon reputation and the regard in
which one is held by one’s neighbors he seems to echo the
sentiment that runs through the earlier Eddic poetry,
especially the “Song of the High One.” “One thing I
know that always remains,” says Woden, “judgment
passed on the dead.”<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c015'><sup>[110]</sup></a> And the Christian scribe more
than three centuries later writes thus of one who has
departed this life: “But if he lived uprightly while on
earth and made proper provision for his soul before he
died, then you may take comfort in the good repute that
lives after him, and even more in the blissful happiness
which you believe he will enjoy with God in the other
world.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c015'><sup>[111]</sup></a> And again he says: “Now you will appreciate
what I told you earlier in our conversation, namely that
much depends on the example that a man leaves after
him.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c015'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The author is also Norse in his emphasis on moderation
in every form of indulgence, on the control of one’s
passion, and in permitting private revenge. His attitude
toward this present world is not medieval: we may enjoy
the good things of creation, though not to excess. On
the matter of revenge, however, his ideas are characteristically
medieval. Private warfare was allowed almost
everywhere in the middle ages, and it appears to have
a place in the political system of the <i>Speculum Regale</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>But on this point too the author urges moderation. “When
you hear things in the speech of other men which offend
you much, be sure to investigate with reasonable care
whether the tales be true or false; but if they prove to
be true and it is proper for you to seek revenge, take
it with reason and moderation and never when heated
or irritated.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c015'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The theology of the <i>King’s Mirror</i>, as far as it can be
discerned, is also medieval, though it is remarkable that
the Virgin and the saints find only incidental mention in
the work. No doubt if the author had been able to complete
his treatise as outlined in his introduction, he
would have discussed the forms and institutions of the
church at greater length and we should be able to know
to what extent his theological notions were in agreement
with the religious thought of the age.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this connection his theory of penance and punishment
for crime is of peculiar interest. He makes considerable
use of Biblical narratives to illustrate his
teachings and refers at length to some of the less worthy
characters of Holy Writ, including certain men who
suffered death for criminal offenses. Almost invariably
he justifies the punishment by arguing that it was better
for the criminal to suffer a swift punishment in death
than to suffer eternally in hell. Apparently his theory is
that a criminal can cleanse himself in his own blood,
that a temporal death can save him from eternal punishment.
The idolaters who were slain by Moses and the
Levites<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c015'><sup>[114]</sup></a> “were cleansed in their penance and in the
pangs which they suffered when they died; and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>much better for them to suffer a brief pain in death than
a long torture in hell.” The sacramental efficiency of the
death penalty seems also to extend to the one who executes
punishment: for those who assisted Moses in the
slaughter sanctified their hands in the blood of those
who were slain. In the same way “a king cleanses
himself in the blood of the unjust, if he slays them as a
rightful punishment to fulfil the sacred laws.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c015'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There can be little doubt that this doctrine of the
death penalty also shows the influence of the great civil
conflict which ended with the death of Duke Skule in
1240. During a century of factional warfare there had
been much violence, much slaughter, much “swift
punishment.” Applied to Norwegian history the author’s
argument amounts to a justification of the slaughter
at Elgesæter; for Skule and his partisans had rebelled
against the Lord’s anointed. The hands of the
Birchshanks were cleansed and sanctified in the blood
of the rebels; but the author also has this comforting
assurance for the kinsmen of the fallen, that their souls
were not lost: Skule and his companions were cleansed
from their sins in the last great penance of death.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may also be that this same long record of violence,
treason, and rebellion was responsible for the prominence
that the <i>King’s Mirror</i> gives to the duty of obedience.
In the political ethics of the work obedience is the
chief virtue and the central principle. Conversely disobedience
is the greatest of all sins. When Saul spared the
Amalekites, whom the Lord had ordered him to destroy,
he sinned far more grievously than did David when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>dishonored Uriah’s wife and afterward brought about
Uriah’s death; for Saul neglected to carry out the commands
of God, and “no offense is graver than to be
disobedient toward one’s superiors.”<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c015'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>King’s Mirror</i> is a medieval document; it was in
large part inspired by the course of events in Norway
during the century of the civil wars; it records the scientific
and political thought of a certain definite period in
Norwegian history. But even though the author of the
work must be classed among the thinkers of his own
time, his place is far in advance of most of his fellows.
His outlook on the world is broader than that of most
medieval writers. In matters of science he is less credulous
and less bound by theological thought than others
who wrote on these subjects in his own century or
earlier. On such questions as the cause of earthquakes
and the source of the northern lights he shows an open-mindedness,
which is rarely met with in the middle
ages.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c015'><sup>[117]</sup></a> For the author’s view of life was not wholly medieval;
on many subjects we find him giving utterance
to thoughts which have a distinctly modern appearance.
His theory of the state and its functions is distinctly
unorthodox. But it is probably in the field of education
where the great Northman is farthest in advance of his
time. In his day the work of instruction was still in the
hands of the church; and the churchmen showed no
great anxiety to educate men except for the clerical
profession. The <i>King’s Mirror</i>, however, teaches that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>merchants must also be educated: they must learn the
art of reckoning and those facts of science that are of
interest to navigators; they must study languages,
Latin, French, and Norwegian; and they must become
thoroughly acquainted with the laws of the land. But
the author does not stop here: a merchant should also
educate his children. “If children be given to you, let
them not grow up without learning a trade; for we may
expect a man to keep closer to knowledge and business
when he comes of age, if he is trained in youth while
under control.”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c015'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The identity of the author of the <i>Speculum Regale</i> has
never been disclosed. Anonymous authorship was not
uncommon in medieval Norse literature: many of the
sagas were written by men whose names are not known.
In the thirteenth century, however, it had become customary
for writers to claim the honors of authorship.
Our philosopher of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> clearly understood
that his readers would be curious to know his name: if
the book, he tells us in his introductory chapter, has
any merit, that should satisfy the reader, and there is
no reason why any one should wish to search out the
name of the one who wrote it.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c015'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Evidently he had a purpose
in concealing his identity, and the motive is not
far to seek.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the death of King Sverre (1202) the conflict between
the king and the hierarchy ceased for a time. The
church made peace with the monarchy; the exiled
bishops returned; and the faction of the Croziermen
disintegrated. After a few years, however, the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>quarrels broke out anew. On the accession of Hakon IV
the church yielded once more, though the prelates did
not renounce their earlier claims. In 1245, when plans
were being made for King Hakon’s coronation, the
bishops put forth the suggestion that the king should,
on that occasion, renew the agreement of 1163, which
gave the bishops control of the succession. But the
great king refused. “If we swear such an oath as King
Magnus swore, then it seems to us as though our honor
would be lessened by it rather than increased.”<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c015'><sup>[120]</sup></a> He
flatly asserted that he would be crowned without any
conditions attached to the act, or the crown “shall
never come upon our head.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After the arrival of Cardinal William of Sabina, who
had been sent by the pope to officiate at the coronation,
and while preparations for that joyous event were going
forward, the subject was brought up once more. On the
suggestion of the Norwegian bishops the cardinal asked
the king to take Magnus Erlingsson’s oath; but the
king again refused, and the cardinal decided that “there
is no need to speak of it oftener.”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c015'><sup>[121]</sup></a> The king was
crowned and there was peace between the two great
forces of church and monarchy, at least so long as
Hakon lived. Sometime not long before or after the
coronation of the great king (1247) the <i>King’s Mirror</i>
seems to have been written. It is clear that such ideas
as are enunciated in this work with respect to the submission
of the church to the authorities of the state can
not have been relished by the hierarchy, and perhaps
they were just then somewhat unwelcome to the secular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>rulers as well, since a discussion of this sort might tend
to renew ill feeling and stir up strife. Consequently the
author may have thought it wiser to remain anonymous.</p>

<p class='c010'>Earlier students of the <i>Speculum Regale</i> have believed
that the author was some local chieftain, who had spent
his more active days at the royal court, but who had
later retired to his estates and was spending his declining
years in literary pursuits. Various efforts have been
made to find this chieftain,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c015'><sup>[122]</sup></a> but with no success; there
is no evidence that the lords or crusaders who have been
suggested as probable authors had any literary interests
or abilities. There can be no doubt that the author was
at one time a prominent member of the royal retinue;
he asserts in several places that such was the case.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c015'><sup>[123]</sup></a> He
is, furthermore, too thoroughly familiar with the organization
of the royal household to have been an occasional
courtier merely. At the same time it is not likely
that he was a secular lord; it seems impossible that he
could have been anything but a churchman. He knows
the Latin language; he is well acquainted with sacred
history; he has read a considerable number of medieval
books. It is quite unlikely that the various types of
learning that are reflected in the chapters of the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> could be found in the thirteenth century in any
scholar outside the clerical profession. He could not
have been one of the higher ecclesiastics, as the prelates
belonged to the faction of the Croziermen. The <i>Speculum
Regale</i> was evidently written by a member of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Norwegian priesthood, though it is possible that he belonged
to one of the minor orders. But at all events he
was a professional churchman.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c015'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There was an old belief in Norway that the work was
written at King Sverre’s court, perhaps by the priest-king
himself;<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c015'><sup>[125]</sup></a> but this theory is wholly without foundation.
Professor Ludvig Daae, believing that only a
few Northmen possessed the necessary qualifications for
the authorship of such a work as the <i>King’s Mirror</i>, concluded
that it must have been written by Master
William, one of the chaplains at the court of Hakon IV.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c015'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
Master William was evidently a man of some erudition;
he held a degree (<i>magister</i>) from a European university;
he must have traveled abroad and was no doubt a man
of experience; he lived and flourished in the period when
the work must have been composed. But there is no
shred of evidence that Master William actually wrote
the <i>King’s Mirror</i> or that he was interested in the problems
that are discussed in this work.</p>

<p class='c010'>More recently A. V. Heffermehl has made an attempt
to prove that the author so long sought for was Ivar
Bodde, a Norwegian priest, who seems to have played
an important part in the history of Norway in the first
half of the thirteenth century as an influential member
of the anti-clerical party.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c015'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Much is not known of Ivar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Bodde, and nearly all that we do know comes from a
speech which he is reported to have delivered in his own
defence in 1217.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c015'><sup>[128]</sup></a> He entered King Sverre’s service “before
the fight was at Strindsea,” which was fought in the
summer of 1199. This was also the year in which King
Sverre seems to have issued his famous <i>Address</i>. “I had
good cheer from the king while he lived, and I served
him so that at last I knew almost all his secret matters.”
In King Inge’s reign (1204-1217) he served in the capacity
of chancellor: “and that besides, which was
much against my wish, they relied on me for writing
letters.” During the same reign he also served as Prince
Hakon’s foster father, and was consequently responsible
for the education of the great king.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c015'><sup>[129]</sup></a> Ivar was also
skilled in military arts: he was a warrior as well as a
priest.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c015'><sup>[130]</sup></a> He was apparently twice sent to England on
diplomatic errands, first to the court of King John, later
to that of Henry III.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c015'><sup>[131]</sup></a> He withdrew from the court in
1217. In 1223 he reappears as one of the king’s chief
counsellors. After this year nothing is known of Ivar
Bodde.</p>

<p class='c010'>The author of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> was a professional
churchman who belonged to the anti-clerical faction;
he was a master of the literary art. Ivar Bodde was a
man of this type; nothing is known of his literary abilities,
but it is clear that a man who was entrusted with
the king’s correspondence can not have been without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>literary skill. There seems to be no reason why Ivar
Bodde could not have written the <i>King’s Mirror</i>, and he
may also have had a hand in the preparation of Sverre’s
<i>Address</i>; but that he actually did write either or both
of these important works has not yet been proved; there
may have been other priests in Norway in the thirteenth
century who stood for the divine right of Norwegian
kingship.</p>

<p class='c010'>From certain geographical allusions it is quite clear
that the work was written in Norway and in some part
of the country that would be counted far to the north.
The author mentions two localities in the Lofoten region
and he shows considerable knowledge of conditions elsewhere
in Halogaland;<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c015'><sup>[132]</sup></a> but it is evident that he did not
reside in that part of the kingdom when he was at work
on his great treatise. It is generally agreed that the
home of the <i>Speculum Regale</i> is Namdalen, a region
which lies northeast of the city of Trondhjem and
which touches the border of Halogaland on the north.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c015'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
This conclusion is based on certain astronomical observations
on the part of the author, namely the length of
the shortest day, the daily increase in the length of the
day, and the relationship between the length of the
sun’s path and the sun’s altitude at noon of the longest
and the shortest day.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c015'><sup>[134]</sup></a> The Norwegian astronomer Hans
Geelmuyden has determined that if the author’s statements
on these points are to be regarded as scientific
computations, they indicate a latitude of 65°, 64° 42´,
and 64° 52´ respectively. All these points lie within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>shire of Namdalen.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c015'><sup>[135]</sup></a> As the author can scarcely have
been much more than a layman in the fields of mathematics
and astronomy, the agreement as to results obtained
is quite remarkable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The problem of place is relatively unimportant, but
the question of the date of composition has more than
mere literary interest. There is nothing in the work itself
which gives any clue to the year when it was begun
or completed. It seems evident, however, that it was
written after the period of the civil wars, though while
the terrors of that century of conflicts were yet fresh in
the memories of men. For various other reasons, too,
it is clear that the <i>King’s Mirror</i> was composed in the
thirteenth century and more specifically during the
reign of Hakon IV.</p>

<p class='c010'>The allusion to the Byzantine emperor Manuel Comnenus,<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c015'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
whose reign began in 1143, gives a definite date
from which any discussion of this problem must begin.
It is also clear that the work was written after the church
had begun to lay claim to power in the government of
the state, which was in 1163.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c015'><sup>[137]</sup></a> The author looks back to
an evil time when minorities were frequent and joint
kingships were the rule;<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c015'><sup>[138]</sup></a> but the period of joint rule
virtually came to a close in 1184 when Sverre became
sole king; and the last boy king whom the author can
have taken into account was Hakon IV, who was thirteen
years old when he was given the royal title. It
therefore seems evident that the <i>King’s Mirror</i> was
written after 1217, the year of Hakon’s accession.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>On the other hand, it is also quite evident that the
treatise can not have been written after the great revision
of the Norwegian laws which was carried out
during the reign of Magnus Lawmender. The new court-law,
which was promulgated about 1275, is clearly later
than the <i>Speculum Regale</i>: the fine exacted for the death
of a king’s thegn, which is given as forty marks in the
<i>King’s Mirror</i>, is fixed at a little more than thirteen
marks in Magnus’ legislation. In 1273 the law regulating
the succession to the throne made impossible the
recurrence of joint kingships; but the principle of this
arrangement appears to have been accepted as early as
1260, when the king’s son Magnus was given the royal
title. Another decree, apparently also from Hakon’s
reign, which abolished the responsibility of kinsmen in
cases of manslaughter and deprived the relatives of the
one who was slain of their share in the blood fine, also
runs counter to methods described in the <i>King’s Mirror</i>,
which states distinctly that kinsmen share in the payment.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c015'><sup>[139]</sup></a>
It is therefore safe to conclude that the work was
written some time between 1217 and 1260.</p>

<p class='c010'>The earliest attempt to date the <i>King’s Mirror</i> was
made by the learned Icelander, Hans Finsen. In an
essay included in the Sorö edition (1768) he fixes the
time at about 1164.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c015'><sup>[140]</sup></a> J. Erichsen, who wrote the introduction
to this edition, doubts that it was composed at
so early a date; impressed with the fact that the work
reflects the political views of the Birchshank faction, he
is inclined to place the date of composition some time
in Sverre’s reign or in the last decade of the twelfth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>century.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c015'><sup>[141]</sup></a> The striking resemblance between the ideas
expressed in the treatise and the guiding principles of
Sverre’s regime led the editors of the Christiania edition
to the same conclusion: 1196 or soon after.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c015'><sup>[142]</sup></a> And so it
was held that the work is a twelfth century document
until a Danish artillery officer, Captain Otto Blom, began
to make a careful study of the various types of
weapons, armor, and siege engines mentioned in the
work. His conclusion, published in 1867, was that the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> reflects the military art of the thirteenth
century and that the manuscript was composed in the
latter half of the century, at any rate not long before
1260.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c015'><sup>[143]</sup></a> This conclusion has been accepted by Gustav
Storm,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c015'><sup>[144]</sup></a> Ludvig Daae,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c015'><sup>[145]</sup></a> and virtually all who have
written on the subject since Blom’s study appeared,
except Heffermehl, whose belief that Ivar Bodde was
the author could not permit so late a date, as Ivar, who
was a man of prominence at Sverre’s court about 1200,
must have been an exceedingly aged man, if he were
still living in 1260. Heffermehl is, therefore, compelled
to force the date of composition back to the decade
1230-1240.</p>

<p class='c010'>The weakness of Captain Blom’s argument is that he
supposes the military art described in the <i>Speculum
Regale</i> to be the military art of the North at the time
when the work was written. If all the engines and accoutrements
that the author describes ever came into
use in the North, it was long after 1260. Nearly all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>weapons and devices mentioned were in use in southern
Europe and in the Orient in earlier decades of the thirteenth
century; some of them belong to much earlier
times. If certain engines and devices which Captain
Blom is disposed to regard as mythical are left out of
account, it will be found that only three items fail to
appear in illustrations from the earlier part of the thirteenth
century; and it would not be safe to assume that
these were not in use because no drawing of them has
been found.</p>

<p class='c010'>Viewed against the background of Norwegian history,
those chapters of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> which deal with the
nature and the rights of monarchy and with the place of
the church in the state take on the appearance of a political
pamphlet written to defend and justify the doings
of the Birchshank party. The motives for composing an
apology of this sort may be found at almost any time in
the thirteenth century but especially during the decade
that closed with the coronation of Hakon IV. It will be
remembered that the author of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> discusses
the calamities that may befall a kingdom as a
result of joint rule.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c015'><sup>[146]</sup></a> But in 1235, after one of Earl
Skule’s periodic attempts at rebellion, his royal son-in-law
granted him the administration of one-third of the
realm. The grant was ratified the next year with certain
changes: instead of a definite, compact fief the earl now
received territories everywhere in the kingdom. In 1237
Skule was given the ducal title and to many men it
seemed as if the curse of joint kingship was about to
afflict the land once more. Two years later the partisans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>of the duke proclaimed him king: like Adonijah of old
he tried to displace the Lord’s anointed.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c015'><sup>[147]</sup></a> But after a
few months came the surprise of Skule’s forces in
Trondhjem and the duke’s own tragic end in Elgesæter
convent.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c015'><sup>[148]</sup></a> It will be recalled that the author defends
King Solomon’s dealings with Joab and lays down the
principle that the right of sanctuary will not hold
against a king.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c015'><sup>[149]</sup></a> The rebellion of the Norwegian Adonijah
was in 1239; he died the death of Joab in 1240.
Three years later the believers in a strong monarchy
were disturbed by the news that the bishops had revived
the old claim to supremacy in the state. Soon after this
series of events the political chapters of the <i>King’s Mirror</i>
must have been composed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1247, the year of Hakon’s coronation, the hierarchy
was once more reconciled to the monarchy, and nothing
more is heard of ecclesiastical pretensions during the remainder
of the reign. It would seem that after this reconciliation,
no churchman, at least not one of the younger
generation, would care to send such a challenge as the
<i>King’s Mirror</i> out into the world. One of the older men,
one who had suffered with Sverre and his impoverished
Birchshanks, might have wished to write such a work
even after 1247; but after that date the surviving followers
of the eloquent king must have been very few
indeed, seeing that Sverre had now lain forty-five years in
the grave. It is therefore the writer’s opinion, though it
cannot be regarded as a demonstrated fact, that the closing
chapters of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> were written after
1240, the year when Duke Skule was slain, perhaps after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>1243, in which year Norwegian clericalism reasserted itself,
but some time before 1247, the year of Hakon’s coronation
and final reconciliation with the church.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the centuries following its composition the <i>King’s
Mirror</i> appears to have had wide currency in the North.
When the editors of the Sorö edition began to search for
manuscripts, they found a considerable number, though
chiefly fragments, in Norway and Iceland; and traces of
the work were also found in Sweden.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c015'><sup>[150]</sup></a> Thus far twenty-five
manuscripts have come to light; “some of them
are extensive, but many are fragments of only a few
leaves.”<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c015'><sup>[151]</sup></a> Copies of the work were made as late as the
reformation period and even later.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first mention of the <i>Speculum Regale</i> in any
printed work is in Peder Claussön’s “Description of
Norway,”<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c015'><sup>[152]</sup></a> the manuscript of which dates from the
earlier years of the seventeenth century. But more than
one hundred years were still to pass before this important
work was brought to the attention of the literary
world. Early in the eighteenth century, however, great
interest began to be shown in the records of the Old
Northern past. The great Icelandic scholar and antiquarian,
Arne Magnussen, had begun to collect manuscripts
and was laying the foundation of the Arnamagnean collection,
which is one of the treasures of the Danish capital.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Among other things he found several copies and
fragments of manuscripts of the <i>Speculum Regale</i>. No
effort was made to publish any of these before the middle
of the century was past; but about 1760 three young
scholars began to plan editions of this famous work.
The first to undertake this task was Professor Gerhard
Schöning,<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c015'><sup>[153]</sup></a> a Norwegian by birth, who was at the time
rector of the Latin school in Trondhjem but later held
a professorship in the Danish academy at Sorö. Schöning
began the preparation of a Latin translation of the
work, which he planned to publish along with the original
version; but his work was never completed. About
the same time an Icelandic student at the University of
Copenhagen, Hans Finsen,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c015'><sup>[154]</sup></a> later bishop in his native
island, projected an edition, but was unable to carry
out his plans for want of a publisher, and turned his materials
over to others. The third and only successful
attempt at publication was made on the suggestion of
a recently organized association of Icelandic scholars
known as “the Invisible” society. This association requested
Halfdan Einersen,<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c015'><sup>[155]</sup></a> rector of the Latin school
at Holar, one of the members and founders of the “invisible”
body, to prepare an edition. An Icelandic merchant,
Sören Pens, generously offered to bear all the
expense of publication.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c015'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Rector Einersen prepared the text from the best available
Icelandic manuscripts. He also made a Danish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>translation and a Latin paraphrase of the same and forwarded
the whole to Denmark to be published. The
materials were given into the editorial charge of another
learned Icelander, Jon Erichsen, teacher of jurisprudence
at Sorö Academy. Although Jon Erichsen’s name
does not appear on the title page, it is quite clear that
the general excellence of the work is in large measure
due to his careful collation of Einersen’s text with manuscripts
to which the Icelandic rector had not had access.
Professor Erichsen discarded Einersen’s Danish
translation and prepared one of his own. He also found
place in the volume for a dissertation by Hans Finsen,
which was first published in 1766, and in which the
learned theologian discusses various literary problems,
such as the authorship of the work, the date of composition,
and the like. All these materials were brought together
and published at Sorö in 1768. On the whole the
Sorö edition is an excellent piece of work. The Icelandic
text was made with great care and reveals the fact that
the editors were possessed of a critical insight which for
the time was remarkable. The Danish translation is
somewhat stiff and literal and does not always follow
the laws of Danish syntax; but it is generally accurate
and retains an unmistakable flavor of the Old Norse
original.</p>

<p class='c010'>Except for some assistance rendered by Professor
Schöning, the first edition of the <i>King’s Mirror</i> was
the work of Icelanders. The Norwegians were also beginning
to show some interest in their medieval past;
but Norway was still a part of the Danish monarchy,
the political and intellectual center of which was Copenhagen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and for half a century longer the Norwegians
were unable to do anything to promote the publication
of historical materials. However, four years after the
Sorö edition had come from the press, a society of Norsemen
at the University of Copenhagen was organized, the
purpose of which was to further the cause of Norwegian
autonomy. After Norway in 1814 resumed her place
among the nations of Europe, it was only natural that
Norwegian scholars should be attracted to the Old
Norse treasures of the middle ages. So far as the means
of the impoverished state would allow, publication of
the sources of Norwegian history was undertaken. The
first Norwegian historian of distinction was Rudolf Keyser,
professor in the University of Christiania. In his
efforts to draw the attention of his countrymen to the
glories of earlier centuries, he was soon reënforced by
his younger contemporary, the fiery and industrious
scholar and investigator Peter Andreas Munch, who,
though his work is somewhat marred by the fervor of
his patriotism, has not yet found a superior among the
historians of the North. Soon a third was added to these
two: Carl R. Unger, a man of remarkable abilities as a
linguist. These three now undertook to edit a series of
Old Norse texts, among which was the <i>King’s Mirror</i>,
which was published under the auspices of the University
of Christiania in 1848.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Christiania edition is based on the main manuscript
of the <i>Speculum Regale</i>, the manuscript 243 B of
the Arnamagnean collection. This was produced in Norway
some time during the last quarter of the thirteenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>century, perhaps not long after 1275.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c015'><sup>[157]</sup></a> As the manuscript
was incomplete in part, the editors also made use
of the copies which had been made the basis of the earlier
edition. Inasmuch as the materials to be used had
been copied at different times and consequently reflected
various stages of linguistic development, it was thought
desirable to normalize the orthography: and in this part
of their task the editors made use of a fragment which
was thought to belong to a somewhat earlier date than
the main manuscript.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c015'><sup>[158]</sup></a> If this belief is correct, the Christiania
edition must, in respect to orthography, be a comparatively
close approximation of the original manuscript.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1881 a third edition prepared by the German philologist
Otto Brenner was published under the title
<i>Speculum Regale, ein altnorwegischer Dialog</i>. Brenner
based his text on the Norwegian manuscript 243 B,
but he also made use of the Icelandic copy (243 A) and
of some of the older fragments. His edition consequently
includes all the materials that had been used in the earlier
editions. It was Brenner’s purpose to prepare a text
which should give the Norwegian version in its original
form, so far as such a restoration is possible. Though
scholars are not agreed that Brenner achieved his purpose,
all have acknowledged the value of his work, and
since its publication his version has been regarded as
the standard edition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two years ago (1915) the University of Illinois published,
under the editorial direction of Professor George
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>T. Flom, a photographic reproduction of this same manuscript,
243 B. This important linguistic monument
has thus been made accessible to scholars in its original
form. Professor Flom has also prepared the Old Norse
text of the manuscript, which makes a part of the publication,
and has prefaced the whole with an extended
introduction in which he discusses the history of the
manuscript, marginal addenda, abbreviations, and other
paleographic and linguistic problems.</p>

<p class='c010'>Until very recently the Danish version prepared by
Jon Erichsen for the Sorö edition was the only translation
of the <i>Speculum Regale</i> into a modern language.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c015'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
But a few years ago the first part of the work was published
under the title <i>Kongespegelen</i> in the form of a
translation into New Norse, a language of recent origin
based on the spoken dialects of Norway. As these dialects
are closely related to the original idiom of the
North, such a translation can be made with comparative
ease. The work has recently been completed, and in
most respects the New Norse version proves to be a
very satisfactory translation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some years ago a number of American scholars who
have interests in the fields of Scandinavian history, language,
and literature united to form a Society for the
Advancement of Scandinavian Study. The founders believed
that the purpose of the organization might be in
part achieved by encouraging the publication of some
of the great Scandinavian classics in English translation.
It was on the suggestion of this Society that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>writer undertook to prepare the present version of the
<i>King’s Mirror</i>. The translation is based on the text of
the Christiania edition, the readings of which have been
consistently followed, except in a few instances where
the scribe does not seem to have copied his manuscript
correctly; in such cases the most satisfactory variant
readings have been followed.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>I<br /> <br /><span class='small'>INTRODUCTION: NAME AND PURPOSE OF THE WORK</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>I passed all the crafts before my mind’s eye and
studied intently all the practices belonging to each
craft; and I saw a vast multitude walking wearily along
the paths that slope downward from the highways of
virtue into error and vice. Some of these were very steep,
and those who followed them perished in desolate ravines;
for the long, wearisome road had fatigued them,
and they had not enough strength left to climb up the
hillside, nor were they able to find the by-paths that led
back to the highways of virtue.</p>

<p class='c010'>The destruction of this multitude was due, it seemed
to me, to various causes: some perished through ignorance,
for the ways of error were trodden so generally
that they appeared to be the most convenient to follow,
and ignorant men mistook them for highways, since the
majority seemed to walk in them; some perished because
of laziness and carelessness; others feared that
they would suffer derision and contumely, if they walked
the highroad alone; while still others were led astray by
perversity, wickedness, and the various passions.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when I had observed how good morals were
scorned and how the scorners perished, I began to wonder
how to find a road where I should not be traveling
entirely alone and yet would not have to choose one of
those paths where the crowd were exhausting their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>strength, lest the steep climb should weary me, if I
were to make an effort to get back up again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Inasmuch as my father was still living and loved me
well, I thought it would be better to seek his counsel
than after a slight consideration to reach a decision
which might displease him. So I hastened to my father
and laid the whole problem before him. He was a wise
and kind man, and I found that he was pleased when
he heard that my errand was to learn right conduct. He
permitted me to ask whatever I wished about the practices
of the various crafts, and how they differed. He
also promised to make known to me all the usages that
are most properly observed by each craft that I might
ask about. He further promised to point out, as a warning,
the paths of error which most men enter upon when
they leave the highways of virtue. Finally he promised
to show me the by-paths that those may take who
wish to return from wrong roads to the highway.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thereupon I began my inquiry by asking about the
activities of merchants and their methods. At the close
of the first discussion, when my questions had all been
answered, I became bolder in speech and mounted to a
higher point in our review of the conditions of men; for
next I began to inquire into the customs of kings and
other princes and of the men who follow and serve them.
Nor did I wholly omit to ask about the doings of the
clergy and their mode of life. And I closed by inquiring
into the activities of the peasants and husbandmen, who
till the soil, and into their habits and occupation.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when my father had given wise and sufficient replies
to all the questions that I had asked, certain wise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and worthy men, who, being present, had heard my
questions and his wise and truthful answers, requested
me to note down all our conversations and set them in
a book, so that our discussions should not perish as soon
as we ceased speaking, but prove useful and enjoyable
to many who could derive no pastime from us who were
present at these conversations.</p>

<p class='c010'>So I did as they advised and requested. I searched my
memory and pondered deeply upon the speeches and
set them all in a book, not only for the amusement or
the fleeting pastime of those who may hear them, but
for the help which the book will offer in many ways to
all who read it with proper attention and observe carefully
everything that it prescribes. It is written in such
a way as to furnish information and entertainment, as
well as much practical knowledge, if the contents are
carefully learned and remembered. But whoever has
clear and proper insight will realize that, if a book is to
develop these subjects fully, it will have to be a much
larger work than this one.</p>

<p class='c010'>The book has been given a handsome title: it is called
<i>Speculum Regale</i>, not because of pride in him who wrote
it, but because the title ought to make those who hear
it more eager to know the work itself; and for this reason,
too, that if any one wishes to be informed as to
proper conduct, courtesy, or comely and precise forms
of speech, he will find and see these therein along with
many illustrations and all manner of patterns, as in a
bright mirror. And it is called <i>King’s Mirror</i>, because in
it one may read of the manners of kings as well as of
other men. A king, moreover, holds the highest title and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>ought, with his court and all his servants, to observe the
most proper customs, so that in them his subjects may
see good examples of proper conduct, uprightness, and
all other courtly virtues. Besides, every king should look
frequently into this mirror and observe first his own conduct
and next that of the men who are subject to him.
He should reward all whose conduct is good, but should
discipline and compel those to observe good morals who
cannot learn without threats. Although the book is first
and foremost a king’s mirror, yet it is intended for every
one as a common possession; since whoever wishes is
free to look into it and to seek information, as he may
desire, about his own conduct, or any other type of
manners which he may find discussed in the book. And
I believe that no man will be considered unwise or unmannerly
who carefully observes everything that he
finds in this work which is suited to his mode of living,
no matter what his rank or title may be.</p>

<p class='c010'>If any one desires or is curious to hear or study this
book, he need not inquire about the name or the standing
of the man who composed and wrote it, lest perchance
he should reject what may be found useful in it
because of contempt, envy, or hostile feeling of some
sort for the author.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c015'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>This request, however, which surely may be granted
to any man, we should like to make: we ask all good
men who hear this book to give it careful thought and
study; and if there should be aught which seems necessary
to the work but has not been included, whether
concerning morals and conduct or discreet and proper
forms of speech, let them insert it in proper form and
connection. And if they find any matters which seem to
impair the work or to have been discussed at too great
length, let them discreetly remove all such and thus,
amending our ignorance in kindness, help our work to
be appreciated in proper spirit. For it was not pride that
impelled us to labor but good will toward all who seemed
to need and desire knowledge of this sort.</p>

<p class='c010'>When I went to my father with these inquiries that I
have now mentioned, I learned in the very first words
that I addressed to him, how every one ought to salute
or address one’s father.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>II<br /> <br /><span class='small'>“THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Good day,<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c015'><sup>[161]</sup></a> sire! I have come to see you as it behooves
a humble and obedient son to approach a loving
and renowned father; and I pray you to listen with patience
to the questions that I have in mind to ask and
kindly to vouchsafe an answer to each one.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Inasmuch as you are my only son, I am pleased
to have you come often to see me, for there are many
subjects which we ought to discuss. I shall be glad to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>hear what you wish to inquire about and to answer such
questions as are discreetly asked.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> I have heard the common report (which I believe
is true) as to your wisdom, that in all the land it
would be difficult to find a man who has greater insight
into every form of knowledge than you have; for all
those who have difficult matters to settle are eager to
get your decision. I have also been told that the same
was true when you were at the royal court, and that
the entire government, lawmaking, treaty making, and
every other sort of business, seemed to be guided by
your opinion. Now as I am the lawful heir to your
worldly possessions, I should also like to share somewhat
in the heritage of your wisdom. Wherefore I wish
to have you point out to me the beginnings and the alphabet
of wisdom, as far as I am able to learn them from
you, so that I may later be able to read all your learned
writings, and thus follow in your footsteps. For I am
sure that after your decease many will rely on your having
trained me after your own ways.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It pleases me to hear you speak in this wise,
and I shall be glad to answer; for it is a great comfort to
me that I shall leave much wealth for my own true son
to enjoy after my days; but I should scarcely regard him
as a son, though I had begotten him, if he were a fool.
Now if you seek understanding, I will show you the basis
and the beginning of all wisdom, as a great and wise man
once expressed it: to fear Almighty God, this is the beginning
of wisdom.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c015'><sup>[162]</sup></a> But He is not to be feared as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>enemy, but rather with the fear of love, as the Son of
God taught the man who asked him what the substance
of the law was. For the Son of God referred him to the
Scripture that reads as follows: Thou shalt love God
with all thy heart and with all thy strength and with all
thy might.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c015'><sup>[163]</sup></a> Now one should love God above everything
else and fear Him at all times when evil desires arise;
he should banish evil longings for God’s sake, though he
were bold enough to cherish them for men’s sake. Now
if you wish to know what are the beginnings and the
first steps in the pursuit of wisdom, this is the true beginning,
and there is none other. And whoever learns
this and observes it shall not be wanting in true knowledge
or in any form of goodness.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> This is indeed loving counsel, such as one might
expect from you; besides, it is good and easily learned
by every one whom fortune follows. Still, if one is to be
reputed a wise man, it will surely be necessary to take
up many things that pertain to the various crafts.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> This is the beginning and the alphabet of
every good thing. But through the alphabet one learns
to read books, and in the same way it is always better
the more crafts are added to this art. For through the
crafts a man gains wisdom whatever the calling that
he intends to follow, whether that of kingsman,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c015'><sup>[164]</sup></a> yeoman,
or merchant.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>III<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE ACTIVITIES AND HABITS OF A MERCHANT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I am now in my most vigorous years and have a
desire to travel abroad; for I would not venture to seek
employment at court before I had observed the customs
of other men. Such is my intention at present, unless you
should give me other advice.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Although I have been a kingsman rather than
a merchant, I have no fault to find with that calling, for
often the best of men are chosen for it. But much depends
on whether the man is more like those who are
true merchants, or those who take the merchant’s name
but are mere frauds and foisterers, buying and selling
wrongfully.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> It would be more seemly for me to be like the
rightful ones; for it would be worse than one might
think likely, if your son were to imitate those who are
not as they ought. But whatever my fate is to be, I desire
to have you inform me as to the practices of such
men as seem to be capable in that business.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The man who is to be a trader will have to
brave many perils, sometimes at sea and sometimes in
heathen lands,<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c015'><sup>[165]</sup></a> but nearly always among alien peoples;
and it must be his constant purpose to act discreetly
wherever he happens to be. On the sea he must be alert
and fearless.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>When you are in a market town, or wherever you are,
be polite and agreeable; then you will secure the friendship
of all good men. Make it a habit to rise early in the
morning, and go first and immediately to church wherever
it seems most convenient to hear the canonical
hours, and hear all the hours and mass from matins on.
Join in the worship, repeating such psalms and prayers
as you have learned. When the services are over, go out
to look after your business affairs. If you are unacquainted
with the traffic of the town, observe carefully
how those who are reputed the best and most prominent
merchants conduct their business. You must also be
careful to examine the wares that you buy before the
purchase is finally made to make sure that they are
sound and flawless. And whenever you make a purchase,
call in a few trusty men to serve as witnesses as to how
the bargain was made.</p>

<p class='c010'>You should keep occupied with your business till
breakfast or, if necessity demands it, till midday; after
that you should eat your meal. Keep your table well
provided and set with a white cloth, clean victuals, and
good drinks. Serve enjoyable meals, if you can afford it.
After the meal you may either take a nap or stroll about
a little while for pastime and to see what other good
merchants are employed with, or whether any new wares
have come to the borough which you ought to buy. On
returning to your lodgings examine your wares, lest they
suffer damage after coming into your hands. If they are
found to be injured and you are about to dispose of
them, do not conceal the flaws from the purchaser: show
him what the defects are and make such a bargain as you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>can; then you cannot be called a deceiver. Also put a
good price on your wares, though not too high, and yet
very near what you see can be obtained; then you cannot
be called a foister.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally, remember this, that whenever you have an
hour to spare you should give thought to your studies,
especially to the law books; for it is clear that those who
gain knowledge from books have keener wits than
others, since those who are the most learned have the
best proofs for their knowledge. Make a study of all the
laws, but while you remain a merchant there is no law
that you will need to know more thoroughly than the
Bjarkey code.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c015'><sup>[166]</sup></a> If you are acquainted with the law, you
will not be annoyed by quibbles when you have suits to
bring against men of your own class, but will be able to
plead according to law in every case.</p>

<p class='c010'>But although I have most to say about laws, I regard
no man perfect in knowledge unless he has thoroughly
learned and mastered the customs of the place where he
is sojourning. And if you wish to become perfect in
knowledge, you must learn all the languages, first of all
Latin and French, for these idioms are most widely used;
and yet, do not neglect your native tongue or speech.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>IV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> May God reward you, sire, for the love of kinship
that you show in pointing out so many things that
I may find needful,—if I have the good fortune to learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>them and to remember them after they are learned. And
if you think there are any other important matters that
ought to be taken up in this discussion, I shall be glad
to listen attentively.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> There are, indeed, certain matters which
should not be omitted from this discourse, but they can
be stated in a few words, if that seems best. Train yourself
to be as active as possible, though not so as to injure
your health. Strive never to be downcast, for a downcast
mind is always morbid; try rather to be friendly and
genial at all times, of an even temper and never moody.
Be upright and teach the right to every man who wishes
to learn from you; and always associate with the best
men. Guard your tongue carefully; this is good counsel,
for your tongue may honor you, but it may also condemn
you. Though you be angry speak few words and
never in passion; for unless one is careful, he may utter
words in wrath that he would later give gold to have
unspoken. On the whole, I know of no revenge, though
many employ it, that profits a man less than to bandy
heated words with another, even though he has a quarrel
to settle with him. You shall know of a truth that no
virtue is higher or stronger than the power to keep one’s
tongue from foul or profane speech, tattling, or slanderous
talk in any form. If children be given to you, let
them not grow up without learning a trade; for we may
expect a man to keep closer to knowledge and business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>when he comes of age, if he is trained in youth while
under control.</p>

<p class='c010'>And further, there are certain things which you must
beware of and shun like the devil himself: these are
drinking, chess, harlots, quarreling, and throwing dice
for stakes. For upon such foundations the greatest
calamities are built; and unless they strive to avoid
these things, few only are able to live long without
blame or sin.</p>

<p class='c010'>Observe carefully how the sky is lighted, the course
of the heavenly bodies, the grouping of the hours, and
the points of the horizon. Learn also how to mark the
movements of the ocean and to discern how its turmoil
ebbs and swells; for that is knowledge which all must
possess who wish to trade abroad. Learn arithmetic
thoroughly, for merchants have great need of that.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you come to a place where the king or some other
chief who is in authority has his officials, seek to win
their friendship; and if they demand any necessary fees
on the ruler’s behalf, be prompt to render all such payments,
lest by holding too tightly to little things you
lose the greater. Also beware lest the king’s belongings
find their way into your purse; for you cannot know but
that he may be covetous who has those things in charge,
and it is easier to be cautious beforehand than to crave
pardon afterwards. If you can dispose of your wares at
suitable prices, do not hold them long; for it is the wont
of merchants to buy constantly and to sell rapidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you are preparing to carry on trade beyond the
seas and you sail your own ship, have it thoroughly
coated with tar in the autumn and, if possible, keep it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>tarred all winter. But if the ship is placed on timbers too
late to be coated in the fall, tar it when spring opens and
let it dry thoroughly afterwards. Always buy shares in
good vessels or in none at all. Keep your ship attractive,
for then capable men will join you and it will be well
manned. Be sure to have your ship ready when summer
begins and do your traveling while the season is best.
Keep reliable tackle on shipboard at all times, and never
remain out at sea in late autumn, if you can avoid it. If
you attend carefully to all these things, with God’s
mercy you may hope for success. This, too, you must
keep constantly in mind, if you wish to be counted a
wise man, that you ought never to let a day pass without
learning something that will profit you. Be not like
those who think it beneath their dignity to hear or learn
from others such things even as might avail them much
if they knew them. For a man must regard it as great
an honor to learn as to teach, if he wishes to be considered
thoroughly informed.</p>

<p class='c010'>There remain a few minor matters that ought to be
mentioned. Whenever you travel at sea, keep on board
two or three hundred ells of wadmal of a sort suitable
for mending sails, if that should be necessary, a large
number of needles, and a supply of thread and cord. It
may seem trivial to mention these things, but it is often
necessary to have them on hand. You will always need
to carry a supply of nails, both spikes and rivets, of such
sizes as your ship demands; also good boat hooks and
broadaxes, gouges and augers, and all such other tools
as ship carpenters make use of. All these things that I
have now named you must remember to carry with you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>on shipboard, whenever you sail on a trading voyage
and the ship is your own. When you come to a market
town where you expect to tarry, seek lodgings from the
innkeeper who is reputed the most discreet and the most
popular among both kingsmen and boroughmen. Always
buy good clothes and eat good fare if your means
permit; and never keep unruly or quarrelsome men as
attendants or messmates. Keep your temper calm
though not to the point of suffering abuse or bringing
upon yourself the reproach of cowardice. Though necessity
may force you into strife, be not in a hurry to take
revenge; first make sure that your effort will succeed
and strike where it ought. Never display a heated temper
when you see that you are likely to fail, but be sure
to maintain your honor at some later time, unless your
opponent should offer a satisfactory atonement.</p>

<p class='c010'>If your wealth takes on rapid growth, divide it and
invest it in a partnership trade in fields where you do
not yourself travel; but be cautious in selecting partners.
Always let Almighty God, the holy Virgin Mary, and
the saint whom you have most frequently called upon
to intercede for you be counted among your partners.
Watch with care over the property which the saints are
to share with you and always bring it faithfully to the
place to which it was originally promised.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you have much capital invested in trade, divide it
into three parts: put one-third into partnerships with
men who are permanently located in market boroughs,
are trustworthy, and are experienced in business. Place
the other two parts in various business ventures; for if
your capital is invested in different places, it is not likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>that you will suffer losses in all your wealth at one time:
more likely it will be secure in some localities, though
frequent losses be suffered. But if you find that the
profits of trade bring a decided increase to your funds,
draw out the two-thirds and invest them in good farm
land, for such property is generally thought the most
secure, whether the enjoyment of it falls to one’s self or
to one’s kinsmen. With the remaining third you may do
as seems best,—continue to keep it in business or place
it all in land. However, though you decide to keep your
funds invested in trade, discontinue your own journeys
at sea or as a trader in foreign fields, as soon as your
means have attained sufficient growth and you have
studied foreign customs as much as you like. Keep all
that you see in careful memory, the evil with the good;
remember evil practices as a warning, and the good
customs as useful to yourself and to others who may
wish to learn from you.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>V<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SUN AND THE WINDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It is evident that whoever wishes to become informed
on such matters as those which you have now
discussed must first try to determine what is most worth
learning and afterwards to keep in mind all that he has
heard. But in your discussion just recently you mentioned
several things the nature of which I do not understand,
though I have reflected upon your statements,
namely, the lights of the sky and the movements of the
ocean. Moreover, you urged me to learn these things
and stated that there is knowledge in learning them. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>I cannot comprehend them unless I shall hear them explained;
and I know of no other wise master with so
kind a will to teach me these matters as yourself. Therefore,
with your permission, I will ask you to continue
this discussion, so that I may become somewhat better
informed on these subjects: how the lights of the sky and
the course of the heavenly bodies wax and wane; how
the time of the day is told and the hours are grouped;
but especially how the ocean moves and what causes its
restlessness. For sometimes the ocean appears so blithe
and cheerful that one would like to sport with it through
an entire season; but soon it displays such fierce wrath
and ill-nature that the life and property of those who
have anything to do with it are endangered. Now I have
thought that, although the sun completes its course according
to an established law, that fact cannot produce
the unquiet of the sea. If you are disposed to explain
these things further, I shall listen gladly and attentively.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I can indeed give such an explanation, just as
I have heard it from the lips of well-informed men, and
as seems most reasonable according to the insight that
God has given me. The sun has received divers offices:
for it brings light and warmth to all the earth, and the
various parts of the world rejoice in its approaching; but
its course is planned in such a way that it sometimes
withdraws from those regions that it approaches at other
times. When it first comes to visit the east with warmth
and bright beams, the day begins to lift up silvery brows
and a pleasant face to the east wind. Soon the east wind
is crowned with a golden glory and robed in all his raiments
of joy. He eases griefs and regretful sighs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>turns a bright countenance toward his neighbors on
either side, bidding them rejoice with him in his delight
and cast away their winterlike sorrows. He also sends
blazing rays into the face of the west wind to inform
him of his joy and happiness. He advises the west wind,
too, that in the evening he shall be clad in garments
similar to those which the east wind wore in the morning.
Later in the day and at the proper hour the southeast
wind displays the glory of his newly-gotten robes
and sends warming rays with friendly messages into the
face of the northwest wind. But at midday the south
wind reveals how he has been endowed with riches of
heat, sends warm gifts of friendship across to the north
wind, warms his cool face, and invites all the neighboring
winds to share in the abundance of his wealth. As
the day declines the southwest wind with glad face receives
the gentle sheen and genial beams. Having put
away wrath, he reveals his desire for peace and concord;
he commands the mighty billows and steep wave-crests
to subside with waning power and calls forth quickening
dews in a wish to be fully reconciled with all his neighbors.
Gently he blows a refreshing breath into the face
of the northeast wind, warms his wind-chilled lips, and
thaws his frosty brow and frozen cheeks. But when evening
begins, the west wind, clad in splendor and sunset
beauty as if robed for a festal eve, lifts a gleaming brow
above a blithe countenance, and sends a message on
darting beams across to the east wind telling him to
prepare for the festive morrow to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>At sunset the northwest wind begins to raise his fair
brows and with lifted eyelids betokens to all his neighbors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>that the dazzling radiance is now in his keeping.
Thereupon he sends forth a shadow over the face of
the earth proclaiming to all that now come the hours
of rest after the toil of day. But at midnight the north
wind goes forth to meet the coursing sun and leads him
through rocky deserts toward the sparse-built shores.
He calls forth heavy shadows, covers his face with a
broad-brimmed helmet, and informs all that he is arrayed
for the night watch to keep guard over his neighbors
that they may have comfort and untroubled rest
after the heat of day. With cool lips he gently blows
upon the face of the south wind, that he may be better
able to resist the violent heat of the coming day. He
also scatters the dark clouds and clears up the face of
heaven in order that the sun, when light appears, may
be easily able to send forth his warm and radiant beams
in all directions. But on the coming of morn the northeast
wind begins to open his closed eyelids and blinks
to both sides as if to determine whether it is time to rise.
Then he opens quickly his clear eyes as if sated with
sleep after ended rest. Soon he leads forth the gleaming
day into all the homesteads like a fair youth and fitting
herald, to give sure knowledge that the radiant sphere
and shining sun follows close behind and to command
all to be arrayed for his coming. Soon the sun rises and
shoots forth his beams in all directions to watch over
the covenant made by the winds; and after that he goes
on through his ordained course as we have already told.</p>

<p class='c010'>When peace has been established among these chiefs
that we have just named, it is safe to travel wherever
you may wish through the realms of any one of them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Then the sea begins to bar out all violent storms and
make smooth highways where earlier the route was impassable
because of broad billows and mighty waves;
and the shores offer harbors in many places which formerly
gave no shelter. Now, while this covenant holds,
there will be fair sailing for you or any others who wish
to travel to foreign shores or steer their ships over the
perils of the ocean. It is, therefore, the duty of every man,
indeed it is a necessary one, to learn thoroughly when
one may look for dangerous seasons and bad routes, or
when times come when one may risk everything. For
even unwitting beasts observe the seasons, though by
instinct, since they have no intellect. Even the fishes,
though lacking human insight, know how to find security
in the deep seas, while the winter storms are most
violent; but when winter wanes, they move nearer the
shores and find enjoyment as after a sorrow suffered and
past. Later in the spring after the roe has come, they
lay the spawn and bring forth a vast multitude of young
fishes and in this way increase their race, each after its
kind and class. It does, indeed, show great forethought
for unintelligent creatures to provide so carefully against
the coming winter storms, and to bring forth their offspring
at the opening of spring, so that they may enjoy
the calm weather of summer and search for food in
peace and quiet along the wide shores; for thus they
gather strength enough in summer against the ensuing
winter to sustain themselves among other fishes in the
chilly deep.</p>

<p class='c010'>The covenant brings joy to the sky as well as to the
sea; for as spring advances the birds soaring high into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the air rejoice with beautiful songs in the newly made
treaty of these lords as in a coming festival. Their joy
is as great as if they have escaped great and terrible
dangers which might arise from the strife of these chieftains.
Soon they build nests upon the earth and lead
birdlings forth from them, each after its kind. Thus they
increase their species and care for their young in the
summer that these may be able to find their own sustenance
in the winter following. Even the earth rejoices
in this peace-making, for as soon as the sun begins to
pour out its warming rays over the face of the earth,
the ice begins to thaw around the frozen grass roots;
soon fragrant and fair-hued herbs sprout forth, and the
earth shows that she finds gladness and festive joy in
the fresh beauty of her emerald robes. She gladly offers
to all her offspring the sustenance which she had to refuse
them earlier because of the dearth in winter. The
trees that stood with dripping branches and frozen roots
put forth green leaves, thus showing their joy that the
sorrow and distress of winter are past.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unclean and repulsive beasts display insight and understanding
in their ability to determine the proper
time to increase their kind and to come out of their dens.
They also observe the season when it is necessary to flee
the cold and stormy distress of winter and seek shelter
under rocks, in large crags, or in the deep scar of the
landslide till the time to come forth is at hand. Wild
beasts that seek their food in woods or on the mountains
know well how to discern the seasons; for they bear the
begotten offspring while winter is most severe, so that
they may bring forth their young when the grass is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>fresh and the summer is warm. There is a little creeping
thing called the ant, which can teach thoughtful men
much practical wisdom, whether they be merchants or
husbandmen, kings or lesser men. It teaches kings how
to build castles and fortresses; in the same way it teaches
the merchants and the husbandmen with what industry
and at what seasons they ought to pursue their callings;
for he who has proper insight and observes carefully the
activities of the ant will note many things and derive
much profit from them. All other creatures, too, whether
clean or unclean, rejoice in this season, and with vigilant
eyes seek their food in the warm summer time so as to
be able to endure more confidently the perils of a destitute
winter season. Now it is this covenant between
these eight winds that calls forth all the delights of
earth and sky and the calm stirring of the sea according
to the command and mysterious skill of Him Who
ordained in the beginning that thus should all nature
remain until He should change the order of things. Now
if you feel that some of these matters have not yet been
fully cleared up, you may continue your inquiries and
ask what questions you like.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>VI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE TIDES AND THE CHANGES IN THE COURSE OF THE SUN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It was a wise thought, it seems to me, to ask
those questions to which I have just received such fair
replies; and I am encouraged to inquire into certain
other matters, namely the waxing of the sun, the moon,
and the streams or tides of the ocean,—how much and
how rapidly these things wax and wane. Now these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>things that I have brought up for discussion are subjects
which especially touch the welfare of seafaring men, and
it looks to me as if they would profit much from a knowledge
of these matters, since it gives insight into the
right conduct of their profession. And since I intend to
labor diligently in the trader’s calling, I should like very
much, if it can be done, to have you explain further some
of those things that I have just mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Those things that you have now asked about
do not all wax or wane with equal rapidity; for the tide,
when it rises, completes its course in seven days plus
half an hour of the eighth day; and every seventh day
there is flood tide in place of ebb. For the tide rises one
seventh part daily from the time when the rise begins;
and after it turns and begins to fall, it ebbs in the same
way during the next seven days but is retarded as much
as half an hour of the eighth day,<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c015'><sup>[167]</sup></a> which must be added
to the seven days. As to how long an hour should be I
can give you definite information; for there should be
twenty-four hours in two days, that is, a night and a
day, while the sun courses through the eight chief points
of the sky: and according to right reckoning the sun will
pass through each division in three hours of the day. On
the other hand, the moon, while it waxes, completes its
course in fifteen days less six hours;<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c015'><sup>[168]</sup></a> and in a like period
it wanes until the course is complete and another comes.
And it is always true that at this time the flood tide is
highest and the ebb strongest. But when the moon has
waxed to half, the flood tide is lowest and the ebb, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>is quite low. At full moon the flood tide is again very
high and the ebb is strong. But when it has waned to
half, both ebb and flood are quite low. Merchants are,
however, scarcely able to note these changes, as the
course is too swift; for the moon takes such long strides
both in waxing and waning that men, on that account,
find it difficult to determine the divisions of its course.
The sun, on the other hand, completes its course more
slowly both in ascending and declining, so that one
may easily mark all the stages of its course. The sun
moves upward one hundred and eighty-two and one-half
days and three hours and for a like period it recedes
again; it has then completed its entire course, both ascent
and decline, in three hundred days, by the twelve-count<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c015'><sup>[169]</sup></a>
{360}, plus five days and six hours. Every fourth
year this becomes three hundred by the twelve-count
and six days more {366}; this is called leap year, for it
has one day more than the preceding twelvemonth, the
additional hours being gathered into twenty-four, a
night and a day. In Latin all hundreds are counted by
tens, and there are, therefore, properly computed three
hundred by the ten-count plus sixty-six days whenever
leap year occurs, while the intervening years have only
five days and six hours with as many additional days by
the other reckoning as I have just stated.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to your question concerning the growth of the
sun’s path, how one can most clearly discern it, I can
scarcely give an answer so precise as not to be wrong
in part; for the sun’s path does not wax at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>rate in all parts of the earth. I can, of course, answer
according to what I have found in the writings of men
who have treated the subject thoroughly, and it is
generally believed that their words come very near the
truth. I have already told you how many hours there
are in a night and day and gave the number as twenty-four.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c015'><sup>[170]</sup></a>
I have indicated the length of each hour in stating
that three hours pass while the sun moves across
one division of the sky. Now there are some other little
hours called <i>ostensa</i>,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c015'><sup>[171]</sup></a> sixty of which make one of those
that I mentioned earlier. It seems to me quite likely
that, as far north as we are, the sun’s path waxes five
of these little hours in a day and as much less than six
as a twelfth part of a little hour. And as to the growth
of the sun’s path it seems most reasonable to me that
it waxes three-fourths of these hours toward the east
and the west and the remaining fourth in height toward
the zenith. South of us, however, this reckoning will
fail; for north of us the increase is greater and to the
south less than we have just stated; and the farther
south, the greater is the difference, and the sun more
nearly overhead.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>VII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SUBJECT OF THE SUN’S COURSE CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> With your permission I wish to inquire somewhat
more fully into this subject, for I do not quite understand
it. You have said that the sun’s ascent is more
rapid to the north of us, where summer is almost wanting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>while the strength of winter is so overpowering that
summer seems like a mere shadow, and where in many
places both snow and ice lie all through summer just as
in winter, as is true of Iceland and particularly of Greenland.
But I have heard that in the southlands there are
no severe winters, the sun being as hot in winter as it is
with us in summer; and that in winter, when the sun
has less power, both grain and other crops grow, while
in summer the earth cannot endure the fervent heat of
the sun and consequently yields neither grass nor grain;
so that in regions like Apulia and even more so in the
land of Jerusalem the heat of summer causes as great
distress as the cold of winter with us. Now when you
tell me that the sun’s path waxes faster here in the north
than yonder in the south, I cannot see the reason why;
for there the sun’s heat is as great in winter as it is with
us in summer; and it is so much greater in summer that
all vegetation on the earth is scorched by it. Therefore
it seems to me more likely that the sun’s path waxes
most rapidly where the heat is most intense. Now if
you can and will clear this up for me so that I can
grasp it, I shall listen gladly and attentively.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I shall begin my talk on the subject that I am
now to take up with a little illustration, which may help
you to a clearer insight, since you find it so difficult to
believe the facts as stated. If you take a lighted candle
and set it in a room, you may expect it to light up the
entire interior, unless something should hinder, though
the room be quite large. But if you take an apple and
hang it close to the flame, so near that it is heated, the
apple will darken nearly half the room or even more.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>However, if you hang the apple near the wall, it will not
get hot; the candle will light up the whole house; and
the shadow on the wall where the apple hangs will be
scarcely half as large as the apple itself. From this you
may infer that the earth-circle is round like a ball and
not equally near the sun at every point. But where the
curved surface lies nearest the sun’s path, there will the
greatest heat be; and some of the lands that lie continuously
under the unbroken rays cannot be inhabited.
On the other hand, those lands which the sun approaches
with slanting rays may readily be occupied; and yet,
some of these are hotter than others according as they
lie nearer the sun’s path. But when the curved and steep
slope of the sphere-shaped wheel moves up before the
light and the beams of the sun, it will cast the deepest
shadow where its curved surface lies nearest the sun;
and yet, the lands nearest the sun are always hottest.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c015'><sup>[172]</sup></a>
Now I agree with you that Apulia and Jerusalem are
hotter than our own country; but you must know that
there are places where the heat is greater than in either
of those just mentioned, for some countries are uninhabitable
on account of the heat. And I have heard it
stated as a fact, that even when the sun mounts highest,
the night in those regions is very dark and quite long.
From this you must conclude that where the strength
and power of the sun are greater, since it is nearer, it
must ascend and decline more slowly; for the night is
long in summer when the sun mounts highest, and
the day is long in winter when it sinks lowest. Now I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>shall explain this so clearly that you will understand it
fully.</p>

<p class='c010'>You know that here with us in winter the day and the
course of the sun are brief; for so short is the sun’s path
that it passes through but a single region of the sky, and
then only where the sun has considerable strength. But
in many places the sun is not to be seen during a large
part of winter, for example in Halogaland,<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c015'><sup>[173]</sup></a> as we
have not only heard tell but have often and constantly
learned and observed with our own eyes. For we know
definitely that from about November 10 to January 10
there never comes a day so bright up north in Vaag or
at Andenes<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c015'><sup>[174]</sup></a> in Halogaland but that the stars in the
sky are visible at midday as at midnight. And although
the days have so much light that the stars cannot be
seen, nevertheless, in most of the places that we have
mentioned the sun remains invisible till January 23.
But after that date the days lengthen and the sun
mounts so rapidly, that beginning with April 6 daylight
does not disappear before September 17, all the intervening
time being one continuous day, for daylight
never fails in all that while. From this you may safely
conclude that, though the sun is hotter in the southern
lands that we spoke of earlier, its course waxes and
mounts more slowly where the night, even at mid-summer,
is deep and long and dark, and where there is never
a time in the whole twelvemonth when day does not fail.
But in Halogaland, as I have just said, there is no day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in winter and stars are visible at midday when the day
should be brightest; later, however, when the days begin
to lengthen, they grow so rapidly that early in spring
daylight begins to tarry all the night and continues
till much of the autumn is past.</p>

<p class='c010'>There remains one more proof which will seem very
clear to you. You know that in those localities in Halogaland
that we have just mentioned the sun about May 15
begins to shine with the same brightness by night as
by day, never setting either at night or during the day
but shining continuously in this manner and with this
brightness, except when its light is obscured by clouds,
even to July 25. Now you know that the sun is only
moderately warm in Halogaland, and that there is but
a little time in summer when it gives sufficient warmth.
Still, there it is with its blazing disk about as long as we
have just stated, and it maintains the daylight about as
long as we have just computed. But neither fact is true
of the southlands, though the sun is hotter there. Now
these facts give evidence that the sun is more distant
here, for it gives less heat. They also testify to the waxing
of its course, for, since its light is as bright by night
as by day, its path must lengthen more rapidly here.
But yonder it waxes less and more slowly, for there the
night has its prescribed period both for length and darkness
in summer as well as in winter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>VIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE MARVELS OF NORWAY</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I see this so clearly now that I can no longer
gainsay that the sun mounts higher and more rapidly
up the sky where there is almost no day in winter and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>the sunlight is so abundant in summer that it shines by
night as well as by day throughout almost the entire
season. I also see that its course changes much less yonder
where it rises high in winter and gives long days with
much heat and sunshine, though the night in summer is
long and dark. Seafaring traders ought to note the differences
precisely so as to be able to determine what
seas they are upon, whether they lie to the north or to
the south. And it seems unnecessary to inquire any further
into these matters, for I believe that I have had
correct and sufficient answers. Now since we are wearied
with profound questions and thoughtful discourse, let us
rest from these for a while and turn our conversation to
matters of a lighter sort. And even though I should inquire
about things that are not so useful as those others,
which are of the highest utility, I pray you for the sake
of our intimacy to vouchsafe replies to such questions
as I may ask; for my mind is often as eager for amusement
as for things of useful intent. And it may seem
restful in a long talk, if a few questions come up that
can stir the mind to gentle mirth. I do not wish, however,
to bring such themes into our talk unless you give
me permission.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I take it that you will ask no stupid questions,
seeing that you have thus far inquired into such matters
only as seem very pertinent; and you are therefore free
to ask whatever you wish; for if the questions do not
seem appropriate, we are at liberty to drop them as soon
as we like.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> Now that I am permitted to choose a topic for
entertainment, it occurs to me that I have asked too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>little about Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland, and all the
wonders of those lands, such as fire and strange bodies
of water, or the various kinds of fish and the monsters
that dash about in the ocean, or the boundless ice both
in the sea and on the land, or what the Greenlanders
call the “northern lights,” or the “sea-hedges” that
are found in the waters of Greenland.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I am not much disposed to discuss the wonders
that exist among us here in the North, though my
reason may be rather trivial: many a man is inclined to
be suspicious and think everything fiction that he has
not seen with his own eyes; and therefore I do not like
to discuss such topics, if my statements are to be called
fabrications later on, even though I know them to be
true beyond doubt, inasmuch as I have seen some of
these things with mine own eyes and have had daily
opportunity to inquire about the others from men whom
we know to be trustworthy and who have actually seen
and examined them, and therefore know them to be
genuine beyond question. My reason for bringing up
this objection is that a little book has recently come into
our country, which is said to have been written in India
and recounts the wonders of that country. The book
states that it was sent to Emmanuel, emperor of the
Greeks.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c015'><sup>[175]</sup></a> Now it is the belief of most men who have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>heard the book read, that such wonders are impossible,
and that what is told in the book is mere falsehood. But
if our own country were carefully searched, there would
be found no fewer things here than are numbered in
that book which would seem as wonderful, or even more
so, to men of other lands who have not seen or heard
anything like them. Now we call those things fiction
because we had not seen them here or heard of them
before the coming of that book which I have just mentioned.
That little book has, however, been widely circulated,
though it has always been questioned and charged
with falsehood; and it seems to me that no one has derived
honor from it, neither those who have doubted it
nor the one who wrote it, even though his work has been
widely distributed and has served to amuse and tickle
the ear, seeing that what is written in it has always been
called fiction.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>IX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>POPULAR DOUBT AS TO THE GENUINENESS OF MARVELS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Of course I cannot know how widely our talks
will travel either in our days or later; and yet, with your
permission, I will again ask the pleasure of hearing further
speech concerning those matters that we might
think strange in other lands, but which we know are
surely genuine. And we need not be so very skeptical
of this book which is said to have been written in India,
though many marvels are told in it; for there are many
things in our own country, which, though not strange to
us, would seem wonderful to other people, if our words
should fly so far as to come thither where such things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>are unheard of. But if I should express surprise at any
of those tales that are told in that book, it seems to me
not least wonderful that manikins are able to subdue
those great winged dragons which infest the mountains
and desert places there, as the book tells us, and tame
them so completely that men are able to ride them just as
they please like horses, fierce and venomous beasts though
they are said to be and not inclined to allow men in their
neighborhood, still less to be tamed and to do service.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Both such and many other tales are told in
that book which seem so marvelous that many express
their doubts about them; but it seems to me that there
is no need to compare the wonders that are described
there with those that we have in our own country, which
would seem as strange to men yonder as those that you
have just mentioned seem to us. For it must be possible
to tame wild beasts and other animals, though they be
fierce and difficult to manage. But it would seem a
greater marvel to hear about men who are able to tame
trees and boards, so that by fastening boards seven or
eight ells long under his feet, a man, who is no fleeter
than other men when he is barefooted or shod merely
with shoes, is made able to pass the bird on the wing,
or the fleetest greyhound that runs in the race, or the
reindeer which leaps twice as fast as the hart. For there
is a large number of men who run so well on skis that
they can strike down nine reindeer with a spear, or even
more, in a single run. Now such things must seem incredible,
unlikely, and marvelous in all those lands where
men do not know with what skill and cleverness it is
possible to train the board to such great fleetness that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>on the mountain side nothing of all that walks the earth
can escape the swift movements of the man who is shod
with such boards. But as soon as he removes the boards
from his feet, he is no more agile than any other man.
In other places, where men are not trained to such arts,
it would be difficult to find a man, no matter how swift,
who would not lose all his fleetness if such pieces of wood
as we have talked about were bound to his feet. We,
however, have sure information and, when snow lies in
winter, have opportunity to see men in plenty who are
expert in this art.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not long since, we mentioned a certain fact which
must be thought exceedingly strange elsewhere, as it
runs wholly counter to the order which holds good in
most places with respect to the change from night to
day, namely, that here the sun shines as bright and fair
and with as much warmth by night as by day through
a large part of the summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>In our own country, in Möre, there is a bog called the
Bjarkudal bog, which must also seem wonderful: for
every sort of wood that is thrown into it and left there
three winters loses its nature as wood and turns into
stone.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c015'><sup>[176]</sup></a> If it is thrown upon the fire, it will glow like
stone, though before it would have burned like wood.
I have seen and handled many such stones of which the
half that rose above the mire was wooden, while the
part submerged in the bog was wholly petrified. Now
we must call that a marvel, for the bog is located in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>forest which is heavily wooded with young trees of all
sorts; and these are not injured so long as they are green
and growing, but as soon as one is hewn down and, having
begun to decay, is thrown into the bog, it turns into
stone.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>X<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE NATURAL WONDERS OF IRELAND</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I am familiar with all these things since they
are found in our own country, and I have seen them all.
But I have no knowledge of all those other marvels
which are to be found in Iceland, Greenland, and Ireland,
and in the seas about those lands, for of those
things I have heard rumors only.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Those lands, if we are to speak more fully
about them, differ much in character and are not all of
the same appearance. For the wonders of Iceland and
Greenland consist in great frost and boundless ice, or
in unusual display of flame and fire, or in large fishes
and other sea monsters. And these countries are everywhere
barren and unfruitful and consequently almost
unfit for habitation. But Ireland comes near being the
best land that is known to man, though the grape vine
does not grow there.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c015'><sup>[177]</sup></a> And there are many marvels in
Ireland, some of which are of such a character that this
country may be called holier than all others.</p>

<p class='c010'>The country lies on that side of the world where heat
and cold are so well tempered that the weather is never
very hot or very cold. For all through the winter the
cattle find their feed in the open, and the inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>wear almost no clothes there either in winter or in summer.
And so holy is this land beyond all others that no
venomous animal can exist there, either snake or toad.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c015'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
When such animals are brought in from other countries,
they die as soon as they touch the bare earth or rock.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c015'><sup>[179]</sup></a>
And if wood, earth, or sand is taken from that country
and brought to a land where venomous beasts are found,
and the sand or earth is strewn around them where they
lie, they will never be able to cross the circle but must
remain within it and perish. In the same way, if you
take a stick of wood which has come from the country
of which we now speak and trace a circle around them
with it by scratching the soil with the stick, they will
soon all lie dead within the circle. It is told of Ireland
that men scarcely know of another island of equal size
where there are so many holy men. We are also told that
the inhabitants of the country are by nature fierce and
murderous and very immoral. But bloodthirsty though
they be, they have never slain any of the saints who are
so numerous in the land; the holy men who have dwelt
there have all died in sick bed. For the Irish have been
kindly disposed toward all good and holy men, though
they have dealt savagely with each other.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c015'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There is a lake in that country concerning the nature
of which strange tales are told; it is called Logechag<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c015'><sup>[181]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in the native speech. It is quite an extensive lake and
has this property, that if you take a stick of the wood
that some call holm and others holly but is called <i>acrifolium</i><a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c015'><sup>[182]</sup></a>
in Latin and fix it in the lake so that part of it
is in the earth, a part in the water, and a part rising
above, the part in the earth will turn into iron, the part
in the water into stone, while that which stands out
above will remain as before. But if you set any other
sort of wood in the lake, its nature will not change.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c015'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Again, there are two springs on a mountain called
Blandina,<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c015'><sup>[184]</sup></a> which is almost a desert mountain; these
have a peculiar nature. One of them has this property
that if you take either a white sheep, cow, or horse, or
a man with white hair, and wash any one of these with
the water, the white will immediately turn to coal black.
And such is the nature of the other spring in that place
that if a man washes himself in its water, his hair will
turn to a snowy white as if he were an aged man, no
matter what its color be before, whether red or white or
black.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c015'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There is also a lake in that country which the natives
call Loycha. In that lake there is what appears to be a
little floating island; for it floats about in the lake, here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and there approaching the shore sometimes so near that
one may step out upon it; and this occurs most frequently
on Sundays. And such is the property of this
islet that if one who is ill steps out upon it and partakes
of the herbs that grow there, he is healed at once, no
matter what his ailment may be. Another singular fact
is this, that never more than one can come upon it at
one time, though many may wish to do so; for as soon
as one has landed, the island immediately floats away.
It also has this peculiarity that it floats constantly about
in the lake for seven winters; but as soon as the seventh
winter is past, it floats to the shore somewhere and
unites with the other land, as if it had always been
joined to it. But when that moment has come, a crash
like a peal of thunder is heard, and, when the din is past,
another island can be seen in the lake of the same size
and character as the earlier one. Thus it happens regularly
every seventh year that, as soon as the one island
has joined the mainland, another appears, though no
one knows whence it comes.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c015'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There is another little island in that country, which
the natives call Inhisgluer.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c015'><sup>[187]</sup></a> There is a large village on
this island and also a church; for the population is about
large enough for a parish. But when people die there,
they are not buried in the earth but are set up around
the church along the churchyard fence, and there they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>stand like living men with their limbs all shriveled but
their hair and nails unmarred. They never decay and
birds never light on them. And every one who is living
is able to recognize his father or grandfather and all the
successive ancestors from whom he has descended.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is still another quite extensive lake that is
called Logri.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c015'><sup>[188]</sup></a> In that lake is an islet inhabited by men
who live a celibate life and may be called, as one likes,
either monks or hermits; they live there in such numbers
that they fill the island, though at times they are
fewer. It is said concerning this isle that it is healthful
and quite free from diseases, so that people grow aged
more slowly there than elsewhere in the land. But when
one does grow very old and sickly and can see the end
of the days allotted by the Lord, he has to be carried to
some place on the mainland to die; for no one can die of
disease on the island. One may sicken and suffer there,
but his spirit cannot depart from the body before he has
been removed from the island.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another large lake which the natives call Logherne.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c015'><sup>[189]</sup></a>
In this lake there is a great abundance of fish of
the sort that we call salmon; and the fish is sent into all
the country about in such quantities that all have plenty
for table use. In this lake there are also many islands,
one of which is called Kertinagh by the natives. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>island might very well be inhabited, as far as size is
concerned, if men dared occupy it. But it is reported
about this island that the powers of evil have as great
authority over one-half of it as they have in hell itself.
Venturesome men who have tried to settle there have
said that they suffered as great trouble and torment as
souls are believed to suffer in hell. But on the other
half of the island there is a church with a churchyard
about it. Both halves are now deserted, however, though
we are told that over the half where the church is the
demons have no power.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c015'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It once happened in that country (and this seems indeed
strange) that a living creature was caught in the
forest as to which no one could say definitely whether it
was a man or some other animal; for no one could get
a word from it or be sure that it understood human
speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail,
both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire
body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down
the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse,
which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground
when the creature stooped in walking. I believe I have
now recounted most of the marvels that have their origin
in the nature of the land itself, so far as we seem to
have sure knowledge concerning them.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>IRISH MARVELS WHICH HAVE MIRACULOUS ORIGINS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I consider it fortunate that I had some curiosity
to know about these matters, for there are no doubt
many so ill-informed that they have never heard about
such things. Most men who may hear these accounts
are likely to find them marvelous, though also somewhat
informing. But since I gather from your remarks that
there may be certain other things that are wonderful
and seem worth discussing, either native to the land
or having some other origin, I wish to request that
nothing be omitted which you consider worth mentioning,
now that we have taken up these subjects.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> There still remain certain things that may be
thought marvelous; these, however, are not native to
the land but have originated in the miraculous powers
of holy men, and we know of a truth that these do exist.
Certain things are told, too, of which we cannot be sure
whether they are credible or merely the talk of men,
though they are common rumor in that country; but
what follows we know to be true beyond a doubt.</p>

<p class='c010'>In that same lake that I mentioned earlier which is
called Logri, lies a little island named Inisclodran. Once
there was a holy man named Diermicius who had a
church on the isle near which he lived. Into this church
and churchyard of which he is the patron no female
creature is allowed to enter. All beasts are aware of this,
for both birds and other animals which are without
human reason avoid it as carefully as humans do. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>no creature of the female sex ever ventures into that
churchyard, nor could it enter if it tried.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c015'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Once there was a holy man in that country named
Kevinus, who lived in a place called Glumelaga.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c015'><sup>[192]</sup></a> At the
time he lived almost as a hermit, and the event which
we shall now relate occurred in his day. It so befell that
a young man was living with him, a kinsman of his who
was his servant, and the saint loved the youth very
much. But the lad fell ill before his eyes, and the malady
grew so heavy and severe that death seemed imminent.
It was in the spring time, in the month of March, when
the man’s illness was at the worst. Then it happened
that the youth asked his kinsman Kevinus to give him
an apple, saying that he would find relief from his illness
if he got what he asked for. It seemed unlikely, however,
that apples could be gotten in that season, as the buds
had only just begun to swell and sprout forth leaves on
the fruit trees. But because the holy Kevinus grieved
sorely over the illness of his kinsman, and also because
he was unable to procure what he had requested, he
knelt down in prayer and implored God to send him
somewhat of those things, so that his kinsman might find
the relief that he yearned for. Having risen from prayer,
he stepped outside and looked around. Near the house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>stood a willow of large growth. Kevinus looked up
among the branches of the willow as if expecting to find
help and comfort there; then he saw that apples had
grown upon the willow, just as there would be on an
apple tree in the proper season. He picked three apples
and gave them to the youth, and after the lad had eaten
of these, his illness began to leave him and he was cured
of the malady. But the willow has ever since continued
to keep the gift that God gave it on that occasion, for
every year it bears apples like an apple tree; and since
that day these have always been called Saint Kevinus’
apples.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c015'><sup>[193]</sup></a> They have been carried into all parts of Ireland
in order that those who are ill may partake of them;
and they seem to have virtue in all human ailments, for
those who eat of them appear to get relief. But they are
not sweet in taste and would not be wanted if men did
not prize them for their healing properties. Many wonderful
things have come to pass in Ireland which certain
highly endowed saints have brought about in an instant;
and these, too, must seem very marvelous. Thus
far, however, we have spoken only of such things as have
been achieved through a holiness so great that they remain
as a testimony to this day and seem as wonderful
now as on the day when they first occurred. But those
other matters that men regard as surely genuine and
speak of as actual facts we may now proceed to point out.</p>

<p class='c010'>In that country there is also a place called Themar,<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c015'><sup>[194]</sup></a>
which in olden times was apparently a capital or royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>borough; now, however, it is deserted, for no one dares
to dwell there. It was this event that caused the place
to be abandoned: all the people in the land believed
that the king who resided at Themar would always render
just decisions and never do otherwise; although they
were heathen in other respects and did not have the
true faith concerning God, they held firmly to their belief
that every case would be decided properly if that
king passed upon it; and never, they thought, could an
unrighteous decision come from his throne. On what
seems to have been the highest point of the borough,
the king had a handsome and well built castle in which
was a large and beautiful hall, where he was accustomed
to sit in judgment. But once it happened that certain
lawsuits came before the king for decision in which his
friends and acquaintances were interested on the one
side, and he was anxious to support their contentions in
every way. But those who were interested in the suits
on the other side were hostile toward him, and he was
their enemy. So the outcome was that the king shaped
his decision more according to his own wish than to
justice. But because an unrighteous judgment had come
whence all people expected just decisions and because of
this popular belief, the judgment seat was overturned
and the hall and the castle likewise, even to their very
foundations. The site, too, was overturned, so that those
parts of the earth which had formerly pointed downward
were now turned upward; and all the houses and
halls were turned down into the earth and thus it has
been ever since. But because such a great miracle happened
there, no one has since dared to inhabit the place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>nor has any king ventured to set up his throne there;
and yet, it is the loveliest place known in all that country.
It is also thought that if men should attempt to rebuild
the town, not a single day would pass without the
appearance of some new marvel.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is still another wonder in that country which
must seem quite incredible; nevertheless, those who
dwell in the land affirm the truth of it and ascribe it to
the anger of a holy man. It is told that when the holy
Patricius<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c015'><sup>[195]</sup></a> preached Christianity in that country, there
was one clan which opposed him more stubbornly than
any other people in the land; and these people strove to
do insult in many ways both to God and to the holy
man. And when he was preaching the faith to them as
to others and came to confer with them where they held
their assemblies, they adopted the plan of howling at
him like wolves. When he saw that he could do very
little to promote his mission among these people, he
grew very wroth and prayed God to send some form of
affliction upon them to be shared by their posterity as
a constant reminder of their disobedience. Later these
clansmen did suffer a fitting and severe though very
marvelous punishment, for it is told that all the members
of that clan are changed into wolves for a period
and roam through the woods feeding upon the same food
as wolves; but they are worse than wolves, for in all
their wiles they have the wit of men, though they are
as eager to devour men as to destroy other creatures.
It is reported that to some this affliction comes every
seventh winter, while in the intervening years they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>men; others suffer it continuously for seven winters all
told and are never stricken again.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c015'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There is still another matter, that about the men who
are called “gelts,”<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c015'><sup>[197]</sup></a> which must seem wonderful. Men
appear to become gelts in this way: when hostile forces
meet and are drawn up in two lines and both set up a
terrifying battle-cry, it happens that timid and youthful
men who have never been in the host before are
sometimes seized with such fear and terror that they
lose their wits and run away from the rest into the forest,
where they seek food like beasts and shun the meeting
of men like wild animals. It is also told that if these
people live in the woods for twenty winters in this way,
feathers will grow upon their bodies as on birds; these
serve to protect them from frost and cold, but they have
no large feathers to use in flight as birds have. But so
great is their fleetness said to be that it is not possible
for other men or even for greyhounds to come near
them; for those men can dash up into a tree almost as
swiftly as apes or squirrels.</p>

<p class='c010'>There happened something once in the borough called
Cloena,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c015'><sup>[198]</sup></a> which will also seem marvelous. In this town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>there is a church dedicated to the memory of a saint
named Kiranus.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c015'><sup>[199]</sup></a> One Sunday while the populace was
at church hearing mass, it befell that an anchor was
dropped from the sky as if thrown from a ship; for a
rope was attached to it, and one of the flukes of the
anchor got caught in the arch above the church door.
The people all rushed out of the church and marveled
much as their eyes followed the rope upward. They saw
a ship with men on board floating before the anchor
cable; and soon they saw a man leap overboard and dive
down to the anchor as if to release it. The movements of
his hands and feet and all his actions appeared like those
of a man swimming in the water. When he came down
to the anchor, he tried to loosen it, but the people immediately
rushed up and attempted to seize him. In this
church where the anchor was caught, there is a bishop’s
throne. The bishop was present when this occurred and
forbade his people to hold the man; for, said he, it might
prove fatal as when one is held under water. As soon as
the man was released, he hurried back up to the ship;
and when he was up the crew cut the rope and the ship
sailed away out of sight. But the anchor has remained
in the church since then as a testimony to this event.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c015'><sup>[200]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>I believe we have now mentioned all the features of
this country that are most worth discussing. But there
is one other matter that I can tell about, if you wish, for
the sport or amusement of it. Long time ago a clownish
fellow lived in that country; he was a Christian, however,
and his name was Klefsan.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c015'><sup>[201]</sup></a> It is told of this one
that there never was a man who, when he saw Klefsan,
was not compelled to laugh at his amusing and absurd
remarks. Even though a man was heavy at heart, he
could not restrain his laughter, we are told, when he
heard that man talk. But Klefsan fell ill and died and
was buried in the churchyard like other men. He lay
long in the earth until the flesh had decayed from his
bones, and his bones, too, were largely crumbled. Then
it came to pass that other corpses were buried in the
same churchyard, and graves were dug so near the place
where Klefsan lay that his skull was unearthed, and it
was whole. They set it up on a high rock in the churchyard,
where it has remained ever since. But whoever
comes to that place and sees that skull and looks into
the opening where the mouth and tongue once were immediately
begins to laugh, even though he were in a
sorrowful mood before he caught sight of that skull.
Thus his dead bones make almost as many people laugh
as he himself did when alive. Now I know of no further
facts about that country which appear to be suitable
materials with which to lengthen a talk like this.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE MARVELS OF THE ICELANDIC SEAS:<br />WHALES; THE KRAKEN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Now since we have discussed everything in Ireland
that may be counted marvelous, let us have a talk
about Iceland and the wonders that are found in the
Icelandic seas.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Aside from the whales in the ocean, there
are, I should say, but few things in the Icelandic waters
which are worth mentioning or discussing. The whales
vary much both in kind and size. Those that are called
blubber-cutters—and they are the most numerous—grow
to a length of twenty ells;<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c015'><sup>[202]</sup></a> a great many of them
are, however, so small that they measure only ten ells;
the rest are in between, each having its own size. These
fishes have neither teeth nor whalebone, nor are they
dangerous either to ships or men, but are rather disposed
to avoid the fishermen. Nevertheless, they are constantly
being caught and driven to land by the hundreds,
and where many are caught, they provide much
food for men.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c015'><sup>[203]</sup></a> There are also other varieties of small
whales, such as the porpoise, which is never longer than
five ells, and the caaing whale, which has a length of
seven ells only.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another kind of whales called the grampus,
which grow no longer than twelve ells and have teeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>in proportion to their size very much as dogs have.
They are also ravenous for other whales just as dogs
are for other beasts. They gather in flocks and attack
large whales, and, when a large one is caught alone,
they worry and bite it till it succumbs. It is likely, however,
that this one, while defending itself with mighty
blows, kills a large number of them before it perishes.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are two other varieties, the beaked whale and
the “hog whale,” the largest of which are not more than
twenty-five ells in length. These are not fit to be eaten,
for the fat that is drawn from them cannot be digested
either by man or by any beast that may partake of it.
For it runs through them and even through wood; and
after it has stood a while, scarcely any vessel can contain
it, even if made of horn. There are certain other
types which are worth a passing mention only, namely
the “raven whale” and the white whale.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c015'><sup>[204]</sup></a> The white
whales are so named because of their snow white color,
while most other varieties are black, except that some
of them have spots, such as the “shield whale,” the
“spear whale,” and the baleen whale. All these kinds
that I have just mentioned may be freely eaten and
many other kinds too.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another sort of whales called the “fish
driver,”<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c015'><sup>[205]</sup></a> which is perhaps the most useful of all to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>men; for it drives the herring and all other kinds of
fish in toward the land from the ocean outside, as if
appointed and sent by the Lord for this purpose. This
is its duty and office as long as the fishermen keep the
peace on the fishing grounds. Its nature is also peculiar
in this, that it seemingly knows how to spare both ships
and men. But when the fishermen fall to quarreling and
fighting, so that blood is spilt, this whale seems able to
perceive it; for it moves in between the land and the
fish and chases the shoals back into the ocean, just as
it earlier had driven them in toward the men. These
whales are not more than thirty ells in length, or forty
at the very largest. They would provide good food, if
men were allowed to hunt them, but no one is permitted
to catch or harm them, since they are of such great and
constant service to men.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another kind is called the sperm whale. These are
toothed whales, though the teeth are barely large
enough to be carved into fair-sized knife handles or
chess men. They are neither fierce nor savage, but rather
of a gentle nature, and so far as possible they avoid the
fishermen. In size they are about like those that I mentioned
last. Their teeth are so numerous that more than
seventy can be found in the head of a single whale of
this sort.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still another species is called the right whale;<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c015'><sup>[206]</sup></a> this
has no fins along the spine and is about as large as
the sort that we mentioned last. Sea-faring men fear
it very much, for it is by nature disposed to sport with
ships.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>There is another kind called the Greenland shark,<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c015'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
which is peculiar in this, that it has caul and fat in the
abdomen like cattle. The largest of these whales grow
to a length of thirty ells at most.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are certain varieties that are fierce and savage
toward men and are constantly seeking to destroy them
at every chance. One of these is called the “horse
whale,” and another the “red comb.”<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c015'><sup>[208]</sup></a> They are very
voracious and malicious and never grow tired of slaying
men. They roam about in all the seas looking for ships,
and when they find one they leap up, for in that way
they are able to sink and destroy it the more quickly.
These fishes are unfit for human food; being the natural
enemies of mankind, they are, in fact, loathsome. The
largest of this type never grow more than thirty or forty
ells in length.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is still another sort called the narwhal, which
may not be eaten for fear of disease, for men fall ill and
die if they eat of it. This whale is not large in size; it
never grows longer than twenty ells. It is not at all savage
but rather tries to avoid fishermen. It has teeth in its
head, all small but one which projects from the front of
the upper jaw. This tooth is handsome, well formed, and
straight as an onion stem. It may grow to a length of
seven ells and is as even and smooth as if shaped with
a tool. It projects straight forward from the head when
the whale is traveling; but sharp and straight though it
is, it is of no service as a defensive weapon; for the whale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>is so fond and careful of its tusk that it allows nothing
to come near it. I know of no other varieties of whales
that are unfit for human food, only these five that I
have now enumerated: the two that I mentioned first
were the beaked whale and the “hog whale;” the three
mentioned later were the “horse whale,” the “red
comb,” and the narwhal.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are certain varieties of even greater size which
I have not yet described; and all those that I shall now
discuss may be eaten by men. Some of them are dangerous
for men to meet, while others are gentle and peaceable.
One of these is called humpback; this fish is large
and very dangerous to ships. It has a habit of striking
at the vessel with its fins and of lying and floating just
in front of the prow where sailors travel. Though the
ship turn aside, the whale will continue to keep in front,
so there is no choice but to sail upon it; but if a ship does
sail upon it, the whale will throw the vessel and destroy
all on board. The largest of these fishes grow to a length
of seventy or eighty ells; they are good to eat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then there is that kind which is called the Greenland
whale.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c015'><sup>[209]</sup></a> This fish grows to a length of eighty or even
ninety ells and is as large around as it is long; for a
rope that is stretched the length of one will just reach
around it where it is bulkiest. Its head is so large that it
comprises fully a third of the entire bulk. This fish is
very cleanly in choice of food; for people say that it
subsists wholly on mist and rain and whatever falls into
the sea from the air above. When one is caught and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>entrails are examined, nothing is found in its abdomen
like what is found in other fishes that take food, for the
abdomen is empty and clean. It cannot readily open
and close its mouth, for the whalebone which grows in
it will rise<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c015'><sup>[210]</sup></a> and stand upright in the mouth when it is
opened wide; and consequently whales of this type often
perish because of their inability to close the mouth.
This whale rarely gives trouble to ships. It has no teeth
and is fat and good to eat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then there is a kind of whale called the rorqual, and
this fish is the best of all for food. It is of a peaceful disposition
and does not bother ships, though it may swim
very close to them. This fish is of great size and length;
it is reported that the largest thus far caught have measured
thirteen times ten ells, that is, one hundred and
thirty ells by the ten-count. Because of its quiet and
peaceful behavior it often falls a prey to whale fishers.
It is better for eating and smells better than any of the
other fishes that we have talked about, though it is said
to be very fat; it has no teeth. It has been asserted, too,
that if one can get some of the sperm of this whale and
be perfectly sure that it came from this sort and no
other, it will be found a most effective remedy for eye
troubles, leprosy, ague, headache, and for every other
ill that afflicts mankind. Sperm from other whales also
makes good medicine, though not so good as this sort.
And now I have enumerated nearly all the varieties of
whales that are hunted by men.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>There is a fish not yet mentioned which it is scarcely
advisable to speak about on account of its size, which to
most men will seem incredible. There are, moreover,
but very few who can tell anything definite about it,
inasmuch as it is rarely seen by men; for it almost never
approaches the shore or appears where fishermen can
see it, and I doubt that this sort of fish is very plentiful
in the sea. In our language it is usually called the “kraken.”
I can say nothing definite as to its length in ells,
for on those occasions when men have seen it, it has
appeared more like an island than a fish. Nor have I
heard that one has ever been caught or found dead. It
seems likely that there are but two in all the ocean and
that these beget no offspring, for I believe it is always
the same ones that appear. Nor would it be well for
other fishes if they were as numerous as the other whales,
seeing that they are so immense and need so much food.
It is said, that when these fishes want something to eat,
they are in the habit of giving forth a violent belch,
which brings up so much food that all sorts of fish in the
neighborhood, both large and small, will rush up in the
hope of getting nourishment and good fare. Meanwhile
the monster keeps it mouth open, and inasmuch as its
opening is about as wide as a sound or fjord, the fishes
cannot help crowding in in great numbers. But as soon as
its mouth and belly are full, the monster closes its mouth
and thus catches and shuts in all the fishes that just
previously had rushed in eagerly to seek food.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c015'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Now we have mentioned and described most of those
things in the Icelandic waters that would be counted
wonderful, and among them a few that are more plentiful
in other seas than in those which we have just discussed.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE WONDERS OF ICELAND</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Now since we have named most of the species of
fish that roam about in the ocean, those that are worth
mentioning or discussing, I should like to hear about
those features of the land itself that are most worthy of
mention. What do you think of the extraordinary fire
which rages constantly in that country? Does it rise
out of some natural peculiarity of the land, or can it be
that it has its origin in the spirit world? And what do
you think about those terrifying earthquakes that can
occur there, or those marvelous lakes, or the ice which
covers all the higher levels?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> As to the ice that is found in Iceland, I am
inclined to believe that it is a penalty which the land
suffers for lying so close to Greenland; for it is to be
expected that severe cold would come thence, since
Greenland is ice-clad beyond all other lands. Now since
Iceland gets so much cold from that side and receives
but little heat from the sun, it necessarily has an over-abundance
of ice on the mountain ridges. But concerning
the extraordinary fires which burn there, I scarcely
know what to say, for they possess a strange nature. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>have heard that in Sicily there is an immense fire of unusual
power which consumes both earth and wood. I
have also heard that Saint Gregory has stated in his
<i>Dialogues</i><a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c015'><sup>[212]</sup></a> that there are places of torment<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c015'><sup>[213]</sup></a> in the
fires of Sicily. But men are much more inclined to believe
that there must be such places of torment in those
fires in Iceland. For the fires in Sicily feed on living
things, as they consume both earth and wood. Trees
live; they grow and put forth green leaves; but they
dry up and wither when they begin to die; therefore,
since they die when they wither, they must be called
living while they are green. The earth, too, must be
called living, inasmuch as it sometimes yields much
fruitage; and as soon as one crop is fallen into decay,
it gives new growth. All living creatures, too, are formed
of earth, and therefore it surely must be called living.
Both these things, earth and wood, the fires of Sicily
can burn and consume as nourishment. The fire of Iceland,
however, will burn neither earth nor wood, though
these be cast upon it; but it feeds upon stone and hard
rock and draws vigor from these as other fires do from
dry wood. And never is rock or stone so hard but that
this fire will melt it like wax and then burn it like fat
oil. But when a tree is cast upon the fire, it will not burn
but be scorched only. Now since this fire feeds on dead
things only and rejects everything that other fires devour,
it must surely be said that it is a dead fire; and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>seems most likely that it is the fire of hell, for in hell all
things are dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>I am also disposed to believe that certain bodies of
water in Iceland must be of the same dead nature as the
fire that we have described. For there are springs which
boil furiously all the time both winter and summer. At
times the boiling is so violent that the heated water is
thrown high into the air. But whatever is laid near the
spring at the time of spouting, whether it be cloth or
wood or anything else that the water may touch when
it falls down again, will turn to stone. This seems to
lead to the conclusion that this water must be dead,
seeing that it gives a dead character to whatever it
sprinkles and moistens; for the nature of stone is dead.
But if the fire should not be dead but have its origin in
some peculiarity of the country, the most reasonable
theory as to the formation of the land seems to be that
there must be many veins, empty passages, and wide
cavities in its foundations. At times it may happen that
these passages and cavities will be so completely packed
with air, either by the winds or by the power of the roaring
breakers, that the pressure of the blast cannot be
confined, and this may be the origin of those great earthquakes
that occur in that country.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c015'><sup>[214]</sup></a> Now if this should
seem a reasonable or plausible explanation, it may be
that the great and powerful activity of the air within
the foundations of the earth also causes those great fires
to be lit and to appear, which burst forth in various
parts of the land.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c015'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Now it must not be regarded as settled that the facts
are as we have just said; we have merely tried to bring
together and compare various opinions in order to determine
what seems most reasonable. For we see that
all fire originates in force. If a hard stone is stricken
against hard iron, fire comes out of the iron and out of
the energy of the stroke when they clash. You can also
rub pieces of wood against each other in such a way that
their antagonism will produce fire. It also happens frequently
that two winds rising at the same time will go
against each other; and when they meet in the air, heavy
blows fall, and these blows give forth a great fire which
spreads widely over the sky.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c015'><sup>[216]</sup></a> At times it also happens
that this fire is driven to the earth where it causes much
damage by burning houses and sometimes forests and
ships at sea. But all the fires that I have now named,
whether they come from iron, or winds colliding in the
air, or any of those mighty forces which can produce
fire, will consume trees, forests, and earth: while the fire
which we discussed earlier and which appears in Iceland
refuses all these things, as I have already shown. Now
these facts lead to this conclusion as to its nature, that
it is more likely to have arisen from dead things or from
like sources, than those other fires that we have now
discussed. And in case it is as we have imagined, it is
likely that the great earthquakes of that country originate
in the power of those mighty fires that well through
the bowels of the land.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE VOLCANIC FIRES OF ICELAND</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I should like very much, with your permission,
to ask further about this fire. You stated earlier in your
remarks that Gregory has written in his <i>Dialogues</i> that
there are places of torment in Sicily; but to me it seems
more likely that those places are in Iceland. You also
said that so vast are the fires in the bowels of the land
that earthquakes arise out of their violent movements;
but if the fires are so destructive to stone and rock that
it melts them like wax and feeds wholly upon them, I
should imagine that it would soon consume all the foundations
beneath the land and all the mountains as well.
Though you may think I am asking childish questions
about these things, still I entreat you to give indulgent
replies; for, of course, one can ask many questions that
reveal youth rather than wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I have no doubt that there are places of torment
in Iceland even in places where there is no burning;
for in that country the power of frost and ice is as
boundless as that of fire. There are those springs of boiling
water which we have mentioned earlier. There are
also ice-cold streams which flow out of the glaciers with
such violence that the earth and the neighboring mountains
tremble; for when water flows with such a swift
and furious current, mountains will shake because of its
vast mass and overpowering strength. And no men can
go out upon those river banks to view them unless they
bring long ropes to be tied around those who wish to
explore, while farther away others sit holding fast the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>rope, so that they may be ready and able to pull them
back if the turbulence of the current should make them
dizzy. Now it seems evident to me that wherever such
a great violence appears and in such terrible forms, there
surely must be places of torment. And God has made
such great and terrifying things manifest upon earth to
man, not only that men may be the more vigilant, and
may reflect that these tortures are indeed heavy to
think upon, although after they depart this life they
will have to suffer those that they see while still on
earth; but even more to make them reflect that greater
still are the things invisible, which they are not permitted
to see. But these things are a testimony, that it
is not untrue what we have been told, that those men
who will not beware of evil deeds and unrighteousness,
while they live on earth, may expect to suffer torment
when they leave this world. For many a simple-minded
man might think that all this was mere deception unworthy
of notice and told merely to terrify, if there were
no such evidence as what we have now pointed out. But
now no one can deny what he sees before his own eyes,
since we hear exactly the same things about the tortures
of hell as those which one can see on the island
called Iceland: for there are vast and boundless fire,
overpowering frost and glaciers, boiling springs, and
violent ice-cold streams.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c015'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>But what you suggested just now, namely that this
fire is likely to melt and consume the mountains and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>foundations of the earth, so that the entire land will be
destroyed, that cannot come to pass before the time
that God has appointed. For neither this created force
nor any other governs itself; but all things are compelled
to move as God’s providence has ordained from the beginning.
And you will understand this better if I take
up certain events that can be used to illustrate these
things.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the lord of death wished to tempt Job, he had
no power to do so before he had asked permission; and
when this had been granted, he did not have power to
carry out his will farther than the permission extended;
for he would gladly have slain Job at once, if that had
been allowed. He was allowed to take away Job’s wealth
and he took it all at the first stroke; but he was not permitted
to destroy the man himself. As he yearned for
permission to tempt him even more severely than he
had already, he was suffered to carry out his will upon
Job’s body and upon all the possessions that belonged
to him. But he was not permitted to separate soul from
body, before the hour should come that He had fixed,
Who has all power over life and destiny. But as soon as
Satan had received permission to carry out his desires
upon Job, he showed immediately how eager he was to
act in such matters as were within his power. For it is
written that Satan took away from Job his abundant
wealth and his seven sons and three daughters, and
smote his body with terrible leprosy from the crown to
the sole of his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now the meaning of this (which ought to be noted
carefully in our minds) is that the Lord of life has power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>over all things and is kindly disposed; while the lord of
death has an evil will, but has power over nothing, except
as he receives authority beforehand from Him
Who rules over all, Who is Almighty God. The devil
can, therefore, injure no one to such an extent that he
is consumed either by the fires of death which he has
kindled and continues to maintain by means of dreadful
earthquakes, or by such other fiendish enmity or
malignity as he delights in. For he is allowed to do
nothing more than the task at hand, as is evident from
what I have just related about the case of Job. And if
it should be thought necessary to cite several examples
in one speech, it will be found that instances of this sort
are both plentiful and convincing.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OTHER ICELANDIC WONDERS: ORE AND MINERAL SPRINGS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It seems evident that the more examples I can
hear you cite of the sort that leads to knowledge, the
better it will be; and from the instance that you have
just given I can see clearly that if Satan was not able to
carry out his will against one man, except as far as he
was permitted, he will surely have even less power to
carry out his desires against many thousands, either by
his own effort or through a servant, except as far as permission
has been given. Now if we are to go on with this
entertaining conversation, as we have been doing, I
should like to know, whether there are any other things
about this island which you think are worth discussing
or which seem remarkable.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><i>Father.</i> We have already mentioned nearly everything
in Iceland that is really worth noticing; but there
are a few other things which I may discuss, if you wish.
In that country there is an abundance of the ore that
iron is made of: it is called “swamp-ore” in the speech
of the people there, and the same term is used among
ourselves. It has happened at times that great deposits
of this ore have been found, and men have prepared to
go thither the next day to smelt it and make iron of it,
only to find it gone, and none can tell what becomes of
it. This is called the “ore-marvel” in that country.
There is still another marvel that men wonder at. It is
reported that in Iceland there are springs which men call
ale-springs. They are so called because the water that
runs from them smells more like ale than water; and
when one drinks of it, it does not fill as other water does,
but is easily digested and goes into the system like ale.
There are several springs in that country that are called
ale-springs; but one is the best and most famous of all;
this one is found in the valley called Hiterdale.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c015'><sup>[218]</sup></a> It is
told about this spring, or the water flowing from it, that
it tastes exactly like ale and is very abundant. It is also
said that if drunk to excess, it goes into one’s head. If a
house is built over the spring it will turn aside from the
building and break forth somewhere outside. It is further
held that people may drink as much as they like
at the spring; but if they carry the water away, it will
soon lose its virtue and is then no better than other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>water, or not so good. Now we have discussed many
and even trifling things, because in that country they
are thought marvelous; and I cannot recall anything
else in Iceland that is worth mentioning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE MARVELS OF THE WATERS ABOUT GREENLAND:<br /> MONSTERS, SEALS, AND WALRUSES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Now that we have entered upon this interesting
conversation and have spoken of the marvels that are
found in Iceland and the Icelandic seas, let us close it
by calling to mind what is worth noting in the waters of
Greenland or in the land itself and the wonders that are
to be seen there.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It is reported that the waters about Greenland
are infested with monsters, though I do not believe
that they have been seen very frequently. Still, people
have stories to tell about them, so men must have seen
or caught sight of them. It is reported that the monster
called merman is found in the seas of Greenland. This
monster is tall and of great size and rises straight out of
the water. It appears to have shoulders, neck and head,
eyes and mouth, and nose and chin like those of a human
being; but above the eyes and the eyebrows it looks
more like a man with a peaked helmet on his head. It
has shoulders like a man’s but no hands. Its body apparently
grows narrower from the shoulders down, so
that the lower down it has been observed, the more
slender it has seemed to be. But no one has ever seen
how the lower end is shaped, whether it terminates in a
fin like a fish or is pointed like a pole. The form of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>prodigy has, therefore, looked much like an icicle. No
one has ever observed it closely enough to determine
whether its body has scales like a fish or skin like a man.
Whenever the monster has shown itself, men have always
been sure that a storm would follow. They have
also noted how it has turned when about to plunge into
the waves and in what direction it has fallen; if it has
turned toward the ship and has plunged in that direction,
the sailors have felt sure that lives would be lost
on that ship; but whenever it has turned away from
the vessel and has plunged in that direction, they have
felt confident that their lives would be spared, even
though they should encounter rough waters and severe
storms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another prodigy called mermaid<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c015'><sup>[219]</sup></a> has also been seen
there. This appears to have the form of a woman from
the waist upward, for it has large nipples on its breast
like a woman, long hands and heavy hair, and its neck
and head are formed in every respect like those of a
human being. The monster is said to have large hands
and its fingers are not parted but bound together by a
web like that which joins the toes of water fowls. Below
the waist line it has the shape of a fish with scales and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>tail and fins. It is said to have this in common with the
one mentioned before, that it rarely appears except before
violent storms. Its behavior is often somewhat like
this: it will plunge into the waves and will always reappear
with fish in its hands; if it then turns toward the
ship, playing with the fishes or throwing them at the
ship, the men have fears that they will suffer great loss
of life. The monster is described as having a large and
terrifying face, a sloping forehead and wide brows, a
large mouth and wrinkled cheeks. But if it eats the
fishes or throws them into the sea away from the ship,
the crews have good hopes that their lives will be spared,
even though they should meet severe storms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now there is still another marvel in the seas of Greenland,
the facts of which I do not know precisely. It is
called “sea hedges,”<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c015'><sup>[220]</sup></a> and it has the appearance as if
all the waves and tempests of the ocean have been collected
into three heaps, out of which three billows are
formed. These hedge in the entire sea, so that no opening
can be seen anywhere; they are higher than lofty
mountains and resemble steep, overhanging cliffs. In a
few cases only have the men been known to escape who
were upon the seas when such a thing occurred. But the
stories of these happenings must have arisen from the
fact that God has always preserved some of those who
have been placed in these perils, and their accounts have
afterwards spread abroad, passing from man to man. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>may be that the tales are told as the first ones related
them, or the stories may have grown larger or shrunk
somewhat. Consequently, we have to speak cautiously
about this matter, for of late we have met but very few
who have escaped this peril and are able to give us tidings
about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>In that same ocean there are many other marvels,
though they cannot be reckoned among the prodigies.
As soon as one has passed over the deepest part of the
ocean, he will encounter such masses of ice in the sea,
that I know no equal of it anywhere else in all the earth.
Sometimes these ice fields are as flat as if they were
frozen on the sea itself. They are about four or five ells
thick and extend so far out from the land that it may
mean a journey of four days or more to travel across
them. There is more ice to the northeast and north of
the land than to the south, southwest, and west; consequently,
whoever wishes to make the land should sail
around it to the southwest and west, till he has come
past all those places where ice may be looked for, and
approach the land on that side.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c015'><sup>[221]</sup></a> It has frequently happened
that men have sought to make the land too soon
and, as a result, have been caught in the ice floes. Some
of those who have been caught have perished; but others
have got out again, and we have met some of these and
have heard their accounts and tales. But all those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>have been caught in these ice drifts have adopted the
same plan: they have taken their small boats and have
dragged them up on the ice with them, and in this way
have sought to reach land; but the ship and everything
else of value had to be abandoned and was lost. Some
have had to spend four days or five upon the ice before
reaching land, and some even longer.</p>

<p class='c010'>These ice floes have peculiar habits. Sometimes they
lie as quiet as can be, though cut apart by creeks or
large fjords; at other times they travel with a speed so
swift and violent that a ship with a fair wind behind is
not more speedy; and when once in motion, they travel
as often against the wind as with it. There is also ice of
a different shape which the Greenlanders call icebergs.
In appearance these resemble high mountains rising out
of the sea; they never mingle with other ice but stand
by themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>In those waters there are also many of those species
of whales which we have already described. It is claimed
that there are all sorts of seals, too, in those seas, and
that they have a habit of following the ice, as if abundant
food would never be wanting there. These are the
species of seals that are found there. One is called the
“corse seal;” its length is never more than four ells.
There is another sort called the “erken-seal,”<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c015'><sup>[222]</sup></a> which
grows to a length of five ells or six at the very longest.
Then there is a third kind which is called the “flett
seal,” which grows to about the same length as those
mentioned above. There is still a fourth kind, called the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>bearded seal, which occasionally grows to a length of
six ells or even seven. In addition there are various
smaller species, one of which is called the saddleback;<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c015'><sup>[223]</sup></a>
it has this name because it does not swim on the belly
like other seals but on the back or side; its length is
never more than four ells. There remains the smallest
kind, which is called the “short seal” and is not more
than two ells in length. It has a peculiar nature; for it is
reported that these seals can pass under flat ice masses
four or even five ells thick and can blow up through
them; consequently they can have large openings where-ever
they want them.</p>

<p class='c010'>There still remains another species which the Greenlanders
count among the whales, but which, it seems to
me, ought rather to be classed with the seals.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c015'><sup>[224]</sup></a> These are
called walrus and grow to a length of fourteen ells or
fifteen at the very highest. In shape this fish resembles
the seal both as to hair, head, skin, and the webbed feet
behind; it also has the swimming feet in front like the
seal. Its flesh like that of other seals must not be eaten
on fast days. Its appearance is distinguished from that
of other seals in that it has, in addition to the other small
teeth, two large and long tusks, which are placed in the
front part of the upper jaw and sometimes grow to a
length of nearly an ell and a half. Its hide is thick and
good to make ropes of; it can be cut into leather strips
of such strength that sixty or more men may pull at one
rope without breaking it. The seals that we have just
discussed are called fish because they find their food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>in the sea and subsist upon other fishes. They may be
freely eaten, though not like the whales, for whale flesh
may be eaten on fast days like other fish food, while these
fishes may be eaten only on the days when flesh food is
allowed. Now I know of nothing else in the waters of
Greenland which seems worth mentioning or reporting,—only
those things that we have just discussed.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE ANIMAL LIFE OF GREENLAND AND THE CHARACTER OF THE LAND IN THOSE REGIONS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> These things must seem wonderful to all who
may hear of them,—both what is told about the fishes
and that about the monsters which are said to exist in
those waters. Now I understand that this ocean must
be more tempestuous than all other seas; and therefore
I think it strange that it is covered with ice both in winter
and in summer, more than all other seas are. I am
also curious to know why men should be so eager to fare
thither, where there are such great perils to beware of,
and what one can look for in that country which can be
turned to use or pleasure. With your permission I also
wish to ask what the people who inhabit those lands live
upon; what the character of the country is, whether it
is ice-clad like the ocean or free from ice even though the
sea be frozen; and whether corn grows in that country
as in other lands. I should also like to know whether you
regard it as mainland or as an island, and whether there
are any beasts or such other things in that country as
there are in other lands.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span><i>Father.</i> The answer to your query as to what people
go to seek in that country and why they fare thither
through such great perils is to be sought in man’s threefold
nature. One motive is fame and rivalry, for it is in
the nature of man to seek places where great dangers
may be met, and thus to win fame. A second motive is
curiosity, for it is also in man’s nature to wish to see
and experience the things that he has heard about, and
thus to learn whether the facts are as told or not. The
third is desire for gain; for men seek wealth wherever
they have heard that gain is to be gotten, though, on
the other hand, there may be great dangers too. But
in Greenland it is this way, as you probably know, that
whatever comes from other lands is high in price, for
this land lies so distant from other countries that men
seldom visit it. And everything that is needed to improve
the land must be purchased abroad, both iron and
all the timber used in building houses. In return for their
wares the merchants bring back the following products:
buckskin, or hides, sealskins, and rope of the kind that
we talked about earlier which is called “leather rope”
and is cut from the fish called walrus, and also the teeth
of the walrus.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to whether any sort of grain can grow there, my
belief is that the country draws but little profit from
that source. And yet there are men among those who
are counted the wealthiest and most prominent who
have tried to sow grain as an experiment; but the great
majority in that country do not know what bread is,
having never seen it. You have also asked about the extent
of the land and whether it is mainland or an island;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>but I believe that few know the size of the land, though
all believe that it is continental and connected with some
mainland, inasmuch as it evidently contains a number
of such animals as are known to live on the mainland
but rarely on islands. Hares and wolves are very plentiful
and there are multitudes of reindeer. It seems to be
generally held, however, that these animals do not inhabit
islands, except where men have brought them
in; and everybody seems to feel sure that no one has
brought them to Greenland, but that they must have
run thither from other mainlands. There are bears, too,
in that region; they are white, and people think they
are native to the country, for they differ very much in
their habits from the black bears that roam the forests.
These kill horses, cattle, and other beasts to feed upon;
but the white bear of Greenland wanders most of the
time about on the ice in the sea, hunting seals and
whales and feeding upon them. It is also as skillful a
swimmer as any seal or whale.</p>

<p class='c010'>In reply to your question whether the land thaws out
or remains icebound like the sea, I can state definitely
that only a small part of the land thaws out, while all
the rest remains under the ice. But nobody knows
whether the land is large or small, because all the mountain
ranges and all the valleys are covered with ice, and
no opening has been found anywhere. But it is quite
evident that there are such openings, either along the
shore or in the valleys that lie between the mountains,
through which beasts can find a way; for they could not
run thither from other lands, unless they should find
open roads through the ice and the soil thawed out.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Men have often tried to go up into the country and
climb the highest mountains in various places to look
about and learn whether any land could be found that
was free from ice and habitable. But nowhere have they
found such a place, except what is now occupied, which
is a little strip along the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is much marble in those parts that are inhabited;
it is variously colored, both red and blue and
streaked with green. There are also many large hawks in
the land, which in other countries would be counted very
precious,—white falcons, and they are more numerous
there than in any other country; but the natives do not
know how to make any use of them.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c015'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

grows in that country; therefore I now want to ask
you what the people who inhabit the land live on, how
large the population is, what sort of food they have, and
whether they have accepted Christianity.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The people in that country are few, for only
a small part is sufficiently free from ice to be habitable;
but the people are all Christians and have churches and
priests. If the land lay near to some other country it
might be reckoned a third of a bishopric; but the Greenlanders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>now have their own bishop,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c015'><sup>[226]</sup></a> as no other arrangement
is possible on account of the great distance
from other people. You ask what the inhabitants live
on in that country since they sow no grain; but men
can live on other food than bread.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c015'><sup>[227]</sup></a> It is reported that
the pasturage is good and that there are large and fine
farms in Greenland. The farmers raise cattle and sheep
in large numbers and make butter and cheese in great
quantities. The people subsist chiefly on these foods and
on beef; but they also eat the flesh of various kinds of
game, such as reindeer, whales, seals, and bears. That
is what men live on in that country.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE CLIMATE OF GREENLAND; THE NORTHERN LIGHTS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I believe I still have some questions to ask about
this country. How do you account for the fact that
Greenland and the ocean that lies about it have greater
masses of ice than any other land or sea? For I gather
from what you have said that the ocean is deep and
also very salt and always in commotion; and I did not
suppose that it could freeze readily there, since, where
the ocean is deep and the water is salt, ice forms with
difficulty, especially when the sea is in turmoil and the
waves roll high. But now I hear about these waters that
we have just talked about and likewise about the land,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>that there is never an interval when the land or the sea
is not covered with ice, except that occasionally an opening
appears here and there in the ice field; but this is
due to the stirring of the sea and not to the heat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now since the land is constantly frozen over in both
winter and summer, I wish to ask you to tell me exactly
how the climate is in Greenland: whether there is any
warmth or fair sunshine as in other lands, or if the
weather is always unpleasant, and whether that is what
causes the excessive ice and frost. I should like to have
you clear this matter up for me along with those things
that I asked about earlier in our conversation, and what
that thing is which the Greenlanders call the northern
lights.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c015'><sup>[228]</sup></a> All these questions I should like to have you
answer, and also this, in what part of the world you believe
that country to be located: whether it lies somewhere
on the edge of the world or about some large bend
in the ocean like other extensive lands, seeing that you
think it is joined to other mainlands.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The matters about which you have now inquired
I cannot wholly clear up for you, inasmuch as I
have not yet found any one who has knowledge of the
entire “home-circle”<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c015'><sup>[229]</sup></a> and its dimensions and who has
explored the whole earth on all its sides, or the nature of
the lands and the landmarks located there. If I had ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>met such a man, one who had seen and examined these
things, I should have been able to give you full information
about them. But I can at least tell you what those
men have conjectured who have formed the most reasonable
opinions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The men who have written best concerning the nature
of the earth, following the guidance of Isidore and other
learned men,<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c015'><sup>[230]</sup></a> state that there are certain zones on the
heavens under which men cannot live. One is very hot
and, because of the glowing heat which burns everything
that comes beneath it, people cannot exist under
this zone. It seems reasonable that this is the broad path
of the sun, and I believe it is because this zone is pervaded
with the sun’s flaming rays that no one who
wishes only a moderately warm dwelling place can live
beneath it. These writers have also said concerning two
other zones in the sky that under them too the land is
uninhabitable; because, on account of their frigidity, it
is no more comfortable to dwell under them than under
the first mentioned where the heat is torrid. For there
the cold has developed such a power that water casts
aside its nature and turns into ice masses; in this way
all those lands become ice-cold, and the seas too, that
lie under either of these two zones. From this I conclude
that there are five zones in the heavens: two under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>which the earth is habitable, and three under which it
is uninhabitable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now all the land that lies under the zones between
the hot and the cold belts can be occupied; but it is
likely that owing to location the lands differ somewhat,
so that some are hotter than others; the hottest being
those that are nearest the torrid belt. But lands that
are cold, like ours, lie nearer the frigid zones, where the
frost is able to use its chilling powers. Now in my opinion
it seems most probable that the hot zone extends from
east to west in a curved ring like a flaming girdle around
the entire sphere. On the other hand, it is quite probable
that the cold zones lie on the outer edges of the world
to the north and south: and in case I have thought this
out correctly, it is not unlikely that Greenland lies under
the frigid belt; for most of those who have visited Greenland
testify that there the cold has received its greatest
strength. Moreover, both sea and land bear testimony in
their very selves that there the frost and the overpowering
cold have become dominant, for both are frozen and
covered with ice in summer as well as in winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been stated as a fact that Greenland lies on the
outermost edge of the earth toward the north; and I do
not believe there is any land in the home-circle beyond
Greenland, only the great ocean that runs around the
earth. And we are told by men who are informed that
alongside Greenland the channel is cut through which
the wide ocean rushes into the gap that lies between the
land masses and finally branches out into fjords and inlets
which cut in between the lands wherever the sea is
allowed to flow out upon the earth’s surface.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>You asked whether the sun shines in Greenland and
whether there ever happens to be fair weather there as
in other countries; and you shall know of a truth that
the land has beautiful sunshine and is said to have a
rather pleasant climate. The sun’s course varies greatly,
however; when winter is on, the night is almost continuous;
but when it is summer, there is almost constant
day. When the sun rises highest, it has abundant power
to shine and give light, but very little to give warmth
and heat; still, it has sufficient strength, where the
ground is free from ice, to warm the soil so that the
earth yields good and fragrant grass. Consequently,
people may easily till the land where the frost leaves,
but that is a very small part.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as to that matter which you have often inquired
about, what those lights can be which the Greenlanders
call the northern lights, I have no clear knowledge. I
have often met men who have spent a long time in
Greenland, but they do not seem to know definitely
what those lights are. However, it is true of that subject
as of many others of which we have no sure knowledge,
that thoughtful men will form opinions and conjectures
about it and will make such guesses as seem reasonable
and likely to be true. But these northern lights
have this peculiar nature, that the darker the night is,
the brighter they seem; and they always appear at
night but never by day,—most frequently in the densest
darkness and rarely by moonlight. In appearance
they resemble a vast flame of fire viewed from a great
distance. It also looks as if sharp points were shot from
this flame up into the sky; these are of uneven height
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and in constant motion, now one, now another darting
highest; and the light appears to blaze like a living
flame. While these rays are at their highest and brightest,
they give forth so much light that people out of
doors can easily find their way about and can even go
hunting, if need be. Where people sit in houses that
have windows, it is so light inside that all within the
room can see each other’s faces. The light is very changeable.
Sometimes it appears to grow dim, as if a black
smoke or a dark fog were blown up among the rays; and
then it looks very much as if the light were overcome by
this smoke and about to be quenched. But as soon as
the smoke begins to grow thinner, the light begins to
brighten again; and it happens at times that people
think they see large sparks shooting out of it as from
glowing iron which has just been taken from the forge.
But as night declines and day approaches, the light begins
to fade; and when daylight appears, it seems to
vanish entirely.</p>

<p class='c010'>The men who have thought about and discussed these
lights have guessed at three sources, one of which, it
seems, ought to be the true one. Some hold that fire
circles about the ocean and all the bodies of water that
stream about on the outer sides of the globe; and since
Greenland lies on the outermost edge of the earth to the
north, they think it possible that these lights shine forth
from the fires that encircle the outer ocean. Others have
suggested that during the hours of night, when the sun’s
course is beneath the earth, an occasional gleam of its
light may shoot up into the sky; for they insist that
Greenland lies so far out on the earth’s edge that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>curved surface which shuts out the sunlight must be
less prominent there. But there are still others who believe
(and it seems to me not unlikely) that the frost
and the glaciers have become so powerful there that
they are able to radiate forth these flames. I know
nothing further that has been conjectured on this subject,
only these three theories that I have presented; as
to their correctness I do not decide, though the last
mentioned looks quite plausible to me. I know of no
other facts about Greenland that seem worth discussing
or mentioning, only those that we have talked about
and what we have noted as the opinions of well-informed
men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SUBJECT OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Everything that you have told here seems wonderful
to me, though also very instructive, and this fact
most of all, that men, as you have pointed out, are able
to leave the earth, as it were, and view for themselves
the boundaries which God has drawn amid such great
perils. Your last remark, however, suggests that there
is yet a little matter to inquire about along this same
line. In speaking of those three conjectures you said
that you think it most likely that these lights have their
origin in frost and ice; but just before in describing their
appearance, you added that now and then fog and dark
mist resembling smoke would mount up among these
lights. But even if the cold should be so prevalent there
as to give rise to these lights with their fire-like rays, I
cannot help wondering whence that smoke can come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>which sometimes appears to shade and becloud the
light till it seems almost quenched; for to me it seems
more likely that the smoke is due to heat than to frost.
There is one more thing that looks strange to me which
you mentioned earlier in your speech, namely that you
consider Greenland as having a good climate, even
though it is full of ice and glaciers. It is hard for me to
understand how such a land can have a good climate.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> When you say, in asking about the smoke
that sometimes appears to accompany the northern
lights, that you think it more likely that the smoke
comes from heat than from cold, I agree with you. But
you must also know that wherever the earth is thawed
under the ice, it always retains some heat down in the
depths. In the same way the ocean under the ice retains
some warmth in its depths. But if the earth were
wholly without warmth or heat, it would be one mass
of ice from the surface down to its lowest foundations.
Likewise, if the ocean were without any heat, it would
be solid ice from the surface to the bottom. Now large
rifts may appear in the ice that covers the land as well
as openings in the ice upon the sea. But wherever the
earth thaws out and lies bare, whether in places where
there is no ice or under the yawning rifts in the glacier,
and wherever the sea lies bare in the openings that have
formed in the ice, there steam is emitted from the lower
depths; and it may be that this vapor collects and appears
like smoke or dark fog; and that, whenever it
looks as if the lights are about to be quenched by smoke
or fog, it is this vapor that collects before them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>In reply to your remark about the climate of Greenland,
that you think it strange that it is called a good
climate, I shall tell you something about the nature of
the land. When storms do come, they are more severe
than in most other places, both with respect to keen
winds and vast masses of ice and snow. But usually
these spells of rough weather last only a short while
and come at long intervals only. In the meantime the
weather is fair, though the cold is intense. For it is in
the nature of the glacier to emit a cold and continuous
breath which drives the storm clouds away from its
face so that the sky above is usually clear.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c015'><sup>[231]</sup></a> But the
neighboring lands often have to suffer because of this;
for all the regions that lie near get severe weather from
this ice, inasmuch as all the storms that the glacier
drives away from itself come upon others with keen
blasts. Now if this is clear to you, I believe there is no
need of giving any further explanation of the subject
than what you have now heard.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE ZONES OF HEAT AND COLD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> These things are all clear to me and it seems
reasonable that they should be as you say. Still, there
are a few things that you mentioned a little earlier in
your talk, which I wish to ask about, if you permit. You
said that both sides of the earth are cold, the southern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>as well as the northern. But I hear it said by all men
who come from the regions to the south that the farther
south one travels, the hotter the lands are. Likewise all
the winds that come from the south are both moister
and milder than other winds. In the winter those winds
always bring a good thaw, while other winds are so cold
that they bring frost, and ice is formed. And during the
summer the south wind is still warmer than other winds.
Now if my questions do not tire you and I do not seem
to ask too much, I should like to have you answer this
question too.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> When I told you that in the skies three belts
are traced under which it is difficult to cross, one torrid
and two frigid, I added that the hot belt curves from
east to west. But if I have stated this correctly, it will
be evident that the cold must be as severe in the southern
parts as in the northern.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c015'><sup>[232]</sup></a> I believe, however, that
all the regions lying near the hot belt, whether on the
south side or on the north, are also hot; but I believe
those lands to be frigid which lie very far in either direction.
You have stated that all men tell us that the
farther south one travels, the greater the heat; but that,
I believe, is due to the fact that you have never found
any one who has traveled as far south of the hot belt as
those lands which we have now talked of lie to the north.
You have also said that the winds which come from a
southerly direction are warmer than the rest. But it is
reasonable that the south wind should be warm when it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>reaches us, even though it comes from the frozen south
side of the earth, for it blows through the curved ring
of the torrid belt.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c015'><sup>[233]</sup></a> Consequently, though it blows cold
from the south, it is warm when it emerges on the northern
side. And if people live as near the cold belt on the
southern side as the Greenlanders do on the northern,
I firmly believe that the north wind blows as warm to
them as the south wind to us. For they must look north
to see the midday and the sun’s whole course, just
as we, who dwell north of the sun, must look to the
south.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have said earlier that in winter the sun’s course
here is short, but of such extraordinary length in summer
that we then have day nearly all the time. From
this you may conclude that the sun’s path is quite
broad and that its course is not narrow and straight as
if it were always following a certain line. As soon as it
reaches the outer edge of its sloping circuit toward the
south, those who live on the extreme side of the world
to the south have summer and long sun paths, while we
have winter and little sunlight. And when the sun comes
to the extreme edge of its circuit to the north, we have
long-continued sunshine, while they have cold winter.
For it is always this way, that the sun rises higher in the
north when its path declines in the south: and when its
course begins to decline in the north, it begins to wax
on the southern side.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>You should also know that the change from day to
night is due to the movements of the sun. For some
places have midday when others have midnight; and
the day dawns and brightens in some places just when
darkness begins and night falls in other places.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c015'><sup>[234]</sup></a> For
the day and the light always follow the sun, while the
shadows flee from it; still they follow after it as it moves
away; and there is always night where the shadows are,
but always day where the light is. Now if you understand
all these things that we have discussed in these
hours, the change in day and night, the course of the
sun, and all the other matters that we have talked
about, you may count yourself thoroughly prepared
for the trader’s calling, inasmuch as few only have had
more instruction in these subjects than you have had.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE WINDS WITH RESPECT TO NAVIGATION</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I should indeed consider it highly informing, if
I could remember all the things that you have now told
me. I gather from your remarks, however, that you
seem to think that I have asked about too many things
in these our talks. But if you are not wearied with my
questions, there still remains a little matter which, with
your permission, I should like to ask about, one that
also seems to belong to the knowledge of seafarers.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a talk some time ago you said that whoever wishes
to be a merchant ought to be prepared early in spring,
and be careful not to remain out at sea too late in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>autumn; but you did not indicate the earliest time in
the spring when you think one may risk a journey over-seas
to other countries, nor how late you consider it
safe to sail the seas in autumn. You told how the ocean
manages to quiet its storms, but you did not show under
what circumstances it begins to grow restless. Therefore
I would fain ask you again to answer this question,
even if it does annoy you, for I think that a time may
come when it will seem both needful to know this and
instructive to understand it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The matters to which you are now referring
can scarcely be grouped under one head; for the seas
are not all alike, nor are they all of equal extent. Small
seas have no great perils, and one may risk crossing
them at almost any time; for one has to make sure of
fair winds to last a day or two only, which is not difficult
for men who understand the weather. And there
are many lands where harbors are plentiful as soon as
the shore is reached. If the circumstances are such that
a man can wait for winds in a good haven or may confidently
expect to find good harbors as soon as he has
crossed, or if the sea is so narrow that he needs to provide
for a journey of only a day or two, then he may venture
to sail over such waters almost whenever he wishes.
But where travel is beset with greater perils, whether
because the sea is wide and full of dangerous currents,
or because the prow points toward shores where the
harbors are rendered insecure by rocks, breakers, shallows,
or sand bars,—wherever the situation is such,
one needs to use great caution; and no one should venture
to travel over such waters when the season is late.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Now as to the time that you asked about, it seems to
me most correct to say that one should hardly venture
over-seas later than the beginning of October. For at
that time the sea begins to grow very restless, and the
tempests always increase in violence as autumn passes
and winter approaches. And about the time when we
date the sixteenth of October, the east wind begins to
look sorrowful and thinks himself disgraced, now that
his headgear, the golden crown, is taken away. He puts
a cloud-covered hat on his head and breathes heavily
and violently, as if mourning a recent loss. But when
the southeast wind sees how vexed his neighbor is, he
is stricken with a double grief: the one sorrow is that
he fears the same deprivation as the east wind has suffered;
the other is grief over the misfortunes of his good
and estimable neighbor. Stirred by the distress of a resentful
mind, he knits his brows under the hiding clouds
and blows the froth violently about him. When the south
wind sees the wrath of his near neighbors, he wraps himself
in a cloud-lined mantle in which he conceals his treasures
and his wealth of warm rays and blows vigorously as
if in terrifying defence. And when the southwest wind
observes how friendship has cooled, now that the truce
is broken, he sobs forth his soul’s grief in heavy showers,
rolls his eyes above his tear-moistened beard, puffs his
cheeks under the cloudy helmet, blows the chilling
scud violently forward, leads forth huge billows, wide-breasted
waves, and breakers that yearn for ships, and
orders all the tempests to dash forward in angry contest.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when the west wind observes that a wrathful
blast and a sorrowful sighing are coming across to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>from the east, whence formerly he was accustomed to
receive shining beams with festive gifts, he understands
clearly that the covenant is broken and that all treaties
are renounced. Deeply grieved and pained because of
the unpeace, he puts on a black robe of mourning over
which he pulls a cloud-gray cloak, and, sitting with
wrinkled nose and pouting lips, he breathes heavily with
regretful care. And when the ill-tempered northwest
wind observes how sorrowful his neighbors look, and
sees how he himself has suffered the loss of the evening
beauty which he was formerly accustomed to display,
he shows at once his temper in stern wrath: he knits his
brows fiercely, throws rattling hail violently about, and
sends forth the rolling thunder with terrifying gleams
of lightning, thus displaying on his part a fearful and
merciless anger. But when the north wind misses the
friendliness and the kind gifts which he was wont to get
from the south wind, he seeks out his hidden treasures
and displays the wealth that he has most of: he brings
out a dim sheen which glitters with frost, places an ice-cold
helmet on his head above his frozen beard, and
blows hard against the hail-bearing cloud-heaps. But
the chill northeast wind sits wrathful with snowy beard
and breathes coldly through his wind-swollen nostrils.
Glaring fiercely under his rimy brows, he wrinkles his
cheeks beneath his cold and cloudy temples, puffs his
jowl with his icy tongue, and blows the piercing drift-snow
vigorously forth.</p>

<p class='c010'>But since peace has been broken among these eight
chiefs and the winds are stirred to stormy violence,
it is no longer advisable for men to travel over-seas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>from shore to shore because of great perils: the days
shorten; the nights grow darker; the sea becomes restless;
the waves grow stronger and the surf is colder;
showers increase and storms arise; the breakers swell
and the shores refuse good harbors; the sailors become
exhausted, the lading is lost, and there is great and constant
destruction of life due to a too great venturesomeness;
souls are placed in perils of judgment because of
recklessness and sudden death. Therefore all sensible
men should beware and not venture upon the sea too
late in the season; for there are many dangers to look
out for and not one alone, if a man dares too much at
such times. Consequently, the better plan is to sail while
summer is at its best; for one is not likely to meet misfortune
if there has been careful and wise forethought.
But it would surely pass all expectations if that were
to succeed which was foolishly advised and planned at
the beginning, though sometimes the outcome may be
favorable. I consider it a more sensible plan for a man
to remain quiet as long as much danger may be looked
for, and to enjoy during the winter in proper style and
in restful leisure what he labored to win during the summer,
than to risk in a little while through his own obstinate
contriving the loss of all the profit which he
strove to gain in the summer. But first of all a man
must have care for his own person; for he can have
no further profit, if it fares so ill that he himself goes
under.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE PROPER SEASON FOR NAVIGATION.</span><br /> <span class='small'>END OF THE FIRST PART</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I did wisely to continue my inquiries when we
had our last talk; for you have given replies which will
be useful as well as instructive for all who have the
sense to understand and profit by such matters as we
have discussed. But I wish to ask you again to tell me
briefly how early in the spring and at what stated time
you think one may venture to travel over-seas to other
shores, just as I asked in my earlier inquiries.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Men may venture out upon almost any sea
except the largest as early as the beginning of April.
For at the time when we date the sixteenth of March,
the days lengthen, the sun rises higher, and the nights
grow shorter. The north wind gently clears up the face
of heaven with a light and cool breeze, brushes away
the restless and storm-laden clouds, and with blithe persuasiveness
asks for a new covenant. Then peace is renewed
among the winds, for they all yearn for rest after
the season of violent wrath and wearisome blasts; so
they make a covenant once more in the way that we
told earlier when we described the peace making. The
showers cease, the waves sink to rest, the breakers flag,
the swell of the noisy ocean dies away, all the storms
weaken, and quiet follows upon restless turmoil.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now I have done as you requested: I have pointed
out the seasons with definite dates both in spring and
fall, when it seems most advisable to brave the perils
of the sea. I have also informed you as to the times that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>seem more suitable for rest than for travel. I have likewise
described briefly the sources of light in the sky and
the belts that are drawn across the heaven, those under
which travel is difficult and those which allow travel.
And if you keep carefully in mind all these things that
I have discussed with you, you will never be counted
among the ignorant navigators, if you shall decide to
try the trader’s calling. My advice, therefore, is first
to fix in your mind all the facts which you have now
heard; and later you shall have a chance to ask further
questions, if you should wish to do so.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND PART:<br /> THE KING AND HIS COURT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> The last time that I had a talk with you, sire,
I heard a wise speech from your lips, one that should
profit every man who intends to follow the craft with
which our conversation was concerned. Since then I
have meditated on that speech, and I believe that I
have fixed firmly in memory most of the facts that were
brought out at the time, whatever luck I may have later
in trying to apply them. No doubt I ought, like everyone
else, to observe carefully all the good which I have
been taught; and more is to be expected from those who
take thought than from those who forget. But whatever
success or good fortune I may have in the practice, I
delight to learn while I have the opportunity. Now I
still have some subjects in mind which I wish to inquire
about, but I am going to ask your consent to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>discussion before I bring up the questions in which I
am now interested; and when I have presented these,
I shall await your answers.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> When we last met and talked about the doings
and mode of living of merchants, we mentioned,
I believe, most of the things that were in real need of
discussion; and I feel sure that no man will have ill
repute from his conduct who everywhere observes with
care what was then brought out. But if you still wish
and are anxious to make further inquiries into these
matters, I shall be glad to answer, if I can. And even
if you wish to open another discussion, I shall also be
glad to answer, as far as I have knowledge. You have
permission, therefore, to ask just as you like; and on
my side there shall be such replies as God enables me
to give.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> The talk that I last heard you give concerning
the business of merchants was delivered with more evident
wisdom in the answers than in the questions; and
I shall now let that subject rest. As I have in mind,
with your permission, to try that business, it may be
that a very long time will pass between our conversations.
And when I am far away from you, I shall have
no opportunity to seek your advice, though I should
wish to do so, in case my mind should turn to some craft
or business other than that of the merchant’s trade.
But though, God willing, we may meet again in good
health, it seems to me advisable to ask about those
things that I am interested in, while I have sure opportunity
to learn. And while there is opportunity we
should learn what we do not know, for this reason especially,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>that we cannot be sure of a chance to inquire
when it seems most needful to seek knowledge. Now
after having learned the trader’s mode of living and
how to travel in unknown lands, it might happen that
I should want to visit the king’s court, where I could
see more perfect manners than those to be seen on my
commercial tours; and therefore I should like to learn
from you, while here at home, such manners as are most
needful to know, when one is at court, though it is not
sure that I shall have to use them. Now if such an interest
does not seem worthless to you, I should like to
have you inform me as to those customs that I have
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It cannot be called worthless curiosity to
wish to know what customs prevail and must be observed
at the king’s court; for all courtesy and proper
conduct have their origin there, if the mode of life is
as it ought to be and as it was ordained of old. Still,
customs at court are by no means of one sort only, for
there is a multitude of services and offices about the
king, and those of his men who are less in rank are usually
not held to strict manners. Those who are higher
in the service often differ much in manners and deportment,
so that the men who observe the better customs
are, unfortunately, fewer, as a rule, than those who are
moderately courteous, or scarcely so much. Now I do
not know whose conduct you are interested in, that of
the more mannerly or of the greater number.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>XXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE IMPORTANCE OF COURTESY IN THE ROYAL SERVICE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It would be most profitable both for me and
for all others who are interested in unfamiliar subjects,
whether good breeding or other knowledge, to learn
what is best and most useful. For there are but few
masters who can teach such things, and they are all
more difficult to grasp than those subjects which are of
but slight value or wholly worthless. Now since I hear
that there are differences both in the duties of men and
in the customs of the court, I shall ask you to inform
me as to the regulations there and to explain how the
services differ and what belongs to each; also to point
out the customs which seem good to you and which are
surely needful to learn, if one wishes to serve a king
with honor, as well as those which one who wishes to
be reputed a moral man should shun and beware of. I
have this reason, too, for seeking this information so
earnestly, that I have seen men come from a king’s
household, whose conduct I have noted carefully, most
of whom seemed only about as well-bred as those who
had never been at court, or even less than they. Now
I do not know which is the more likely, whether I do
not understand what good breeding means, or that the
facts are as they seemed to me.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> If it should be your fate to serve at court and
you wish to be called courtly and polite, you will need
to beware of what happens to those who come to court
without manners and leave without refinement. But
since you have asked how the services and the usages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>at a royal court differ, I shall now explain that to you,
and also show why some return thence rude and unpolished.
When a dull man fares to court, it is as when
an ignorant fellow travels to Jerusalem, or a simpleton
enters a good school. An ignorant man who has been
to Jerusalem believes himself well informed and tells
many things about his journey, though chiefly what
seems worthless to a knowing man, or mere sport and
foolery. In the same way the simpleton who comes from
school believes himself to be perfectly educated; he
struts about and shows great disdain whenever he meets
one who knows nothing. But when he meets one who
is a real scholar, he himself knows naught. So it is,
too, when stupid men come to the king’s court: they
promptly seek out men of their own kind and learn
from them such things as are most easily grasped and
into which they had gotten some insight earlier; but
this is mere folly and unwisdom. And when they return
from court, they will display such manners and courtesy
as they learned there. And yet, many who come from
strange places, whether from other lands or courts, will
behave in this way; but when those who have remained
at home find that these men bring great tidings, they
come to regard them at once as thoroughly informed,
both as to customs and happenings, seeing that they
have visited alien peoples and foreign lands; and this
is most often the case with dull men. Now if you aim
at good breeding, beware lest you fall into such unwisdom.
We may now take up the question how the
duties of the men at court differ and what belongs to
each service.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>All the men who have gone to the king’s hand<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c015'><sup>[235]</sup></a> are
housecarles; but honors and authority are distributed
among them according to the merits of each and as the
king wishes to grant. Thus one class of housecarles is
made up of men who are always present at court, but
draw no wages, and do not eat and drink where the <i>hirdmen</i>
take their meals. They have to do such service in
the king’s garth as the steward shall assign, whether it
be to go on a journey or to do manual labor in the garth.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE ADVANTAGES DERIVED FROM SERVICE IN THE KING’S HOUSEHOLD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I pray you, sire, not to regard me as thoughtless
or as wishing to interrupt your discourse, if I inquire
briefly about the duties of these men.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> While we are on this subject, you had better
ask what you like, or you may regret it later, having
come away ill-informed about what you wanted to hear,
because you did not inquire sufficiently.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> Since those whom you have just mentioned live
by labor and manual toil in the king’s garth and have
no greater honors than at home in the country, what
advantage do they find in being with the king more
than in serving their parents or kinsmen in the country
or engaging in trade and winning wealth in that way?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> There are many reasons why such men would
rather be at court than live in the country or engage in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>trade. Some prefer being at court to living in the country
(though in the king’s service their labor is as burdensome,
or more so) because, though they are of excellent
kinship, they have little wealth and cannot engage
in trade on account of their poverty. If they take up
work in the country, they find many who have more
wealth, though they are no higher in kinship, or scarcely
so high. And when quarrels arise, the rich find protection
in their wealth and thrust the poor aside, so that
these can get no justice in their law suits. Consequently
such men think it better to toil in security at court than
without protection in the country. Others may have
committed manslaughter or have come into other difficulties
which make it urgent for them to seek security
in the king’s power. Some there are, too, who always
find pleasure in being in a throng; they also feel more
secure there, whatever may happen. When these come
back to the country where earlier they seemed so utterly
defenseless, they regard themselves as the peers of every
one, because of the protection which they enjoy as kingsmen.
If one of them is slain in single combat, the king
will take forty marks<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c015'><sup>[236]</sup></a> in thegn money<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c015'><sup>[237]</sup></a> for him as for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>his other thegns, and, in addition, one mark gold as
housecarle fine,<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c015'><sup>[238]</sup></a> which he exacts whenever a housecarle
is slain.</p>

<p class='c010'>You shall also know that many come to court from
the country who were considered of little consequence
there; and yet, it often happens that the king gives high
honors to such men in return for their service, if they
perform it well, though they are but slightly honored in
their own homes. Those, on the other hand, whom the
cotters in the country seemed to value highly for their
wealth, kindred, and fellowship, are often no more regarded
at the royal court than in their home communities
and sometimes even less. Indeed, those who come
to the king with riches are often honored less than those
who come in poverty. Frequently, men who come to
court with little wealth or none at all and have no choice
but to accept what the king graciously offers are set so
high in riches and power that they tower above their
kinsmen, though before they came to the king they were
not regarded as their equals. They win this either by
bravery in warfare and good deportment at court, or by
being faithful to the king in all things and striving to be
discreet and loving toward him. For the king helps and
promotes those whom he finds to be anxious to remain
truly affectionate toward him and to serve him in loyal
friendship. For these reasons a king by an act of grace,
will very often exalt those who are lacking in riches;
and therefore many such are encouraged to seek service
at court, where they all expect to win rewards, high
honors, and marked advancement in position.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>XXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE VARIOUS CLASSES AMONG THE KINGSMEN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I believe I have now had correct and adequate
answers, and it no longer seems strange to me that such
men as you have just talked about would rather be
kingsmen than remain in the country, even though their
duties are as toilsome as those of the farmer, or even
more so. But now I wish to ask you to describe the other
services at the king’s court, so that I may, if possible,
gain some knowledge of every one of them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> That is surely possible, and since you are interested
in such matters, I shall give you what information
I have concerning them. There are certain other
housecarles at the king’s court, who, in addition to
the housecarle’s title, have a by-name and are called
“gests.”<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c015'><sup>[239]</sup></a> They have this name from their manifold
duties; for they visit the homes of many, though not
always with friendly intent. These men are also in the
king’s pay and get half the wages of “hirdmen.” These
are the duties that belong to the office of these men: they
serve as spies throughout the king’s domain to make
sure whether he has any enemies in his kingdom; and
if such are found, the gests are to slay them, if they are
able to do so. But if the king sends his gests upon his
enemies and those against whom they are sent are slain,
they are to have for their trouble as much of the enemies’
wealth as they can carry away at the time, only
no gold, for that is the king’s, as is all the rest that the
gests are unable to bring away. And whenever the king
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>becomes aware of an enemy, it is the gest’s duty to
pursue the foeman and thus to cleanse the realm. Whenever
they are present at court, they keep the various
watches about the king, just as the others do who share
the king’s bounty in the royal garth, except the head-ward;<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c015'><sup>[240]</sup></a>
this they do not keep; nor do they sit at table
to eat or drink in the house where the king dines with
his hirdmen, except at Christmas and Easter, when they
are to eat with the hirdmen in the king’s hall, but at no
other time. If any of these men be slain in single combat,
the king exacts as large a fine both in thegn money
and housecarle fine as for the death of those whom we
discussed earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is still another class of royal housecarles who
do not share the king’s tables and but rarely come to
court; these receive nothing from the king but protection
and support in securing justice from others; but
these, too, are kingsmen. In case any of these are slain,
the king exacts the same housecarle fine in addition to
the thegn money as in the case of those housecarles who
dine at his tables. These men come into his service from
various walks of life: some are peasants, some merchants,
and some laymen. But this service they owe the
king before all his other subjects, namely, that wherever
the king’s officials come at his command to present the
king’s causes or business, and these housecarles of whom
we are speaking are present, they must join the retinue
of these officials and render such assistance as they can
in all the king’s business. These, too, may claim support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>from the kingsmen in their efforts to obtain justice,
wherever they have suits to bring up. Likewise if any
of these men are slain, the fines due the king will be
increased as much as for those whom we spoke of
earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another class of royal housecarles who receive
money payments from the king, some twelve
<i>aura</i>,<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c015'><sup>[241]</sup></a> some two marks, some three marks, and others
more, in proportion as the king finds them likely to add
to his strength and credit. These men do not dine with
the king at court; they are abroad in the realm in a sort
of official capacity, for some of them are sons of the
king’s landedmen,<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c015'><sup>[242]</sup></a> while others are peasants, though
so wealthy that they seem to rank with the landedmen.
These royal housecarles owe the king the same kind of
service as those whom we have just mentioned, but
more, inasmuch as they have greater prestige and enjoy
greater favors from the king; and the fines due the
king in case these men are ill used will be increased
about as much as has been stated before. From all these
kingsmen that we have now told about, who do not dine
at his tables, the king may demand such service as he
finds each capable of: some are called to pilot the longships
when the king sets out on a naval campaign; some
are sent abroad in embassies to foreign rulers and other
princes; while others are sent out upon the sea as traders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>with the king’s wares or ships.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c015'><sup>[243]</sup></a> These are the duties
that they are bound to perform with such other duties
as may arise out of the king’s needs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now I have told you about several classes of the
king’s servants, and you will have to determine which
of those enumerated seem to you most likely to know
much about courtly behavior and the manners that
ought by right to be found at a king’s court; they are
all kingsmen, however. And from this you will observe
that every man cannot become perfect in all courtly
customs and manners just as soon as he sees the king
and his men; for a man will have to be both quick-witted
and quick to learn, who, if he lacks in breeding,
is to learn perfect courtliness in a year’s time, even
though every day of the year is spent at court among
the hirdmen in the king’s own presence. Now you shall
know this of a truth, that there are many at court who
have spent a large part of their lives there and have
daily opportunities to see good deportment, and yet
they never become either courtly or well-bred.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE HONORED POSITION OF THE KINGSMEN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> If such is the case, that some of the customs at
court are so difficult to learn that both quick wit and
continued observation are necessary, it seems evident
that the men whom you have just now spoken of can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>have but slight knowledge of what constitutes deportment
or good manners in the king’s house, though they
be kingsmen, since they come but rarely into those of
the royal apartments where good manners must especially
be observed. But there is yet something that I
am anxious to know concerning the duties of those men
of whom you spoke last: what profit can such men as
have an abundance of wealth and kinsmen find in the
king’s service and in binding themselves to his service
with the housecarle name as their only title? Why do
not they rather seek the honor of being called hirdmen,
or remain at home looking after their property as other
husbandmen do?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I should say that you have not inquired very
wisely into this matter; still, as you do not appear to be
well informed on this subject, I think it better for you
to question than to remain ignorant, and since you have
inquired I ought to answer. There are many reasons, as
we have already said, why men would rather be kingsmen
than be called by the peasant’s name only. The
first reply must be that the king owns the entire kingdom
as well as all the people in it, so that all the men
who are in his kingdom owe him service whenever his
needs demand it. Thus the king has a right to call upon
every freeman, who seems fitted for it or is found to
possess suitable insight, to serve in embassies to foreign
lords; likewise, when the king calls upon the freemen to
pilot his ship in warfare, each one who is appointed must
attend, though he be the king’s henchman only so far
as he is his subject. Even if a king should order a clerk
or a bishop of his kingdom to fare as envoy to another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>king or to the pope, if such is his wish, the one who is
called must set out, unless he is willing to risk the king’s
enmity and to be driven from the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now since all the men of the realm are thus bound to
the royal service, why should not every sensible man
regard it a greater advantage to be in the king’s full
protection and friendship, no matter what may happen
in his intercourse with other men, and to be superior to
his comrades and hold them loyal to the king if they
will not otherwise obey, than to be called a mere cotter
who is constantly under the control of others, though
he still owes nearly the same duties as otherwise? Verily
you must know that to be called a king’s housecarle is
not to be despised as a title of derision; but it is a name
of great honor to everyone who bears it. For neither
landedmen nor hirdmen, though because of some infirmity
or because they are tired of warfare they prefer
to cultivate an estate in the country, are willing to surrender
the housecarle name because of its honor and
security. Now if there is any phase of this subject that
seems insufficiently inquired into or explained, we may
extend the conversation if you wish.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SUPERIOR ORDER OF KINGSMEN: THE HIRD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> This subject has been discussed almost too fully
and has been cleared up for me with such good and complete
answers that it looks to me as if a man cannot dispense
with the king’s support, if he wishes to found his
cause securely. For the multitude is fickle-minded and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the one unfair toward the other, except those alone to
whom God has given wisdom and rectitude; but they
are few only and not the mass. However, as there are
certain matters relating to the service and manners at
court that are still unexplained, I should like to hear
you discuss these further, lest I continue ignorant about
subjects that I desire to know.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> We must now speak about those of the king’s
housecarles who, if they give proper attention, are best
able to acquire knowledge as to what is counted good
manners in royal circles. They too, however, differ in
character, and those are very often the fewer who should
be the more numerous. These kingsmen that we are now
to discuss have, in addition to the housecarle name, the
title of hirdmen. Some bear that title rightfully, but to
many it is a nickname. The one who originated the
name placed it on a sound basis; for hirdman means the
same as keeper and guardian; and those who wish to
possess this title rightfully should be true keepers and
guardians both of the king’s person and of all his kingship.
They should guard the bounds of equity among all
the men of the realm, wherever they are present when
suits at law are heard. They should also observe good
and courtly behavior and every useful custom, for they
are at all times nearest the king in all matters. They
guard the king’s life and person both night and day;
they are always about the king at the table when he
eats and drinks, at public assemblies, and at all general
gatherings, like near kinsmen.</p>

<p class='c010'>These men ought of right to be addressed as lords by
all men who bear lesser titles than they do; for they are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>in a sense, stewards of the realm, if they observe the
customs that are suited to their title. They should be
chosen from all classes and not from wealthy or distinguished
families only; but those who are chosen to
this dignity should be perfect in all things, both in ancestry
and wealth, and in nobility of mind and courtesy,
but above all in conduct. They ought, furthermore, before
all others to observe righteousness in every form,
so that they may be able to discern clearly what should
be loved as belonging to honor and good deportment
and what should be shunned as leading to dishonor and
shame. For wherever they are present, the eyes of all
men are turned upon their manners and behavior; all
incline their ears to their words; and all expect, as they
ought, to find them so much more excellent than other
men in deeds and deportment as they stand nearer the
king in service and regard than his other men. And if
these men wish by right to enjoy the titles which are
given them along with the housecarle name, they must
shun vulgarity and rudeness; they must also, more than
other men, avoid many things which a foolish desire
might suggest. For many things become a disgrace both
in words and deeds to well-bred men, which are not a
disgrace to the vulgar who behave in that way; wherefore
such men must keep watch over their tongues and
their behavior.</p>

<p class='c010'>It also frequently happens that well trained envoys
from other lands come to visit the king and his court;
and the more polished they are, the more carefully they
observe the royal service as well as the manners of the
king and his courtiers and all the customs that prevail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>at the court. On returning to their own lands, they will
describe the customs and relate the happenings which
they saw or heard at the court to which they were sent.
But all the rumors that travel to other lands and are
circulated about a lord, if they be truthful, will usually
either bring him ridicule and contumely or be turned to
his honor. It may also frequently come to pass that the
kings themselves need to meet in conference to discuss
such rules and arrangements as must be kept jointly by
the kingdoms.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c015'><sup>[244]</sup></a> Wherever kings meet, there the best
men are always assembled; for the kings bring their
chief men with them to such conferences: archbishops,
bishops, earls, landedmen, and hirdmen or knights.
And the conduct and breeding of those who assemble
are carefully noted, first the manners of the mighty ones,
and then those of all the rest; for everyone watches
closely the behavior of all the others. And if one of the
kings or one of his principal men is found indecorous,
he soon becomes the subject of ridicule and contempt
and is regarded as a common churl. And if a king’s retinue
is found to be poorly trained and is lacking in
polish, especially if the service of the king’s apartments
is not performed in a comely and proper manner, then
the king himself is pronounced unfit; for it will be held
that if he himself were polite and perfect in manners,
all would acquire good breeding from him. Consequently
it is possible for a courtly chief to suffer great shame
from a vulgar and indecent man; wherefore it is very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>important that those who wish to bear a comely and
honorable title in the royal presence should be well informed
as to what is becoming or unbecoming. For one
cannot hope for great honors from a king, if he has at
any time disgraced him where many honorable men
were assembled and where it seemed very important to
maintain the king’s honor, which is everywhere, for a
king must nowhere suffer shame. Heedlessness and evil
conduct are therefore ill becoming to a man, if they
bring him shame and enmity and cause him to lose his
honorable name, his good repute, and his fair service,
even though life and limb be spared. And he can even
bring such deep dishonor upon his king that with many
of his kindred he will be made to suffer a well deserved
but ignominious death. Such grades there are both in
the duties and in the titles at the royal court as you
have now heard described. But if it seems to you that
everything has not yet been thoroughly examined, you
may inquire further, if you like.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>HOW A MAN WHO WISHES TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION TO<br /> THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD SERVICE<br /> SHOULD APPROACH THE KING</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It seems to me that we should not fail to continue
this discussion and I shall now direct my remarks
and questions toward some theme that may help me to
see more clearly how one, who comes to seek honors,
should appear in the king’s presence and how he must
afterwards demean himself in order to attain all those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>distinctions of which you have just told. Now it may
happen that I shall want to fare to court and join the
king’s service; for since my father and my kinsmen
served the king before me and gained honor and high
esteem for their service, it is likely that I shall wish to
do what my kinsmen achieved before me. Now inasmuch
as that is likely, I want to ask you to tell me how
I ought to begin my speech when I come to seek audience
with a king. State it as clearly as if you were to
accompany me to the royal presence, and inform me as
to my gestures, my dress, my manner of speech and all
matters of deportment that are becoming in the king’s
company. Now this time I have asked as I thought best;
but even though I have inquired less wisely than I
ought, kindly do as before, giving thought to the questions
on my part and to the replies from your side.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Your questions on this subject are not so unwise
that one may not very well answer them; for many
have need to make such inquiries, if they mean to have
their suits brought up before lords and to have them
planned as carefully as need be. Now I shall try to clear
up these matters that you have asked about, stating
what seems most truthful and advisable. When you
come, then, to where the king resides, intending to become
his man, you should inquire carefully who the
men are in the king’s company that are best able to
present men’s business to the king in such a way that
their speeches please him the most. As soon as you have
learned who they are, you must first make their acquaintance
and cultivate their friendship; after that
make your errand known and ask them to undertake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>your suit. If they undertake your business, they can
best find time and occasion for audience and speech
with the king, as they often have speech with him. If
you are to present your request at a time when the king
is at the table, get sure information whether he is in
good spirits and pleasant humor. If you should observe
that his disposition is somewhat irritable, or that he is
displeased about something, or that he has such important
affairs to consider that you think your business
for that reason cannot be taken up, then let your suit
rest for the time being and seek to find the king in better
humor some other day. But if you find that he is in
merry mood and has no business to take up of such
importance that you may not very well state your
errand, wait, nevertheless, till he has nearly finished
his meal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Your costume you should plan beforehand in such a
way that you come fully dressed in good apparel, the
smartest that you have, and wearing fine trousers and
shoes. You must not come without your coat; and also
wear a mantle, the best that you have. For trousers
always select cloth of a brown dye. It seems quite proper
also to wear trousers of black fur, but not of any other
sort of cloth, unless it be scarlet. Your coat should be
of brown color or green or red, and all such clothes are
good and proper. Your linen should be made of good
linen stuff, but with little cloth used; your shirt should
be short, and all your linen rather light. Your shirt
should be cut somewhat shorter than your coat; for no
man of taste can deck himself out in flax or hemp. Before
you enter the royal presence be sure to have your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>hair and beard carefully trimmed according to the fashions
of the court when you join the same. When I was
at court it was fashionable to have the hair trimmed
short just above the earlaps and then combed down as
each hair would naturally lie; but later it was cut shorter
in front above the eyebrows. It was the style at that
time to wear a short beard and a small moustache; but
later the cheeks were shaved according to the German
mode;<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c015'><sup>[245]</sup></a> and I doubt that any style will ever come which
is more becoming or more suitable in warfare.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now when you seem to be in proper state to appear
before the king both as to dress and other matters, and
if you come at a suitable time and have permission from
the doorkeeper to enter, you must have your coming
planned in such a way that some capable servant can
accompany you. But though you are both allowed to
enter, do not let him follow you farther than inside the
door or, at the farthest, up to the staller’s seat, and
leave him there to keep your mantle. Leave your mantle
behind when you go before the king and be careful to
have your hair brushed smooth, and your beard combed
with care. You must have neither hat nor cap nor other
covering on your head; for one must appear before lords
with uncovered head and ungloved hands, with a blithe
face and with limbs and body thoroughly bathed. You
should also have the men with you who are to present
your suit. Form the habit of holding your head up and
your whole body erect when walking; strike a dignified
gait, but do not walk too slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>When you come into the king’s presence, bow humbly
before him and address him in these words: “God give
you a good day, my lord king!” If the king is at the
table when you appear before him, be careful not to
lean against the king’s board, as so many a simpleton
does; and above all do not lean forward across it as unmannerly
churls do, but remain standing far enough
away from it so that the service belonging to the royal
table may have sufficient space to pass between the
table and yourself. But if the king is not at the table,
approach his seat only so near as to leave abundant
space for all the service between yourself and the footstools
that are before the king’s seat. When standing
before the king, you should dispose of your hands in
such a way that the thumb and forefinger of the right
will grasp the left wrist; and then let your hands drop
slowly before you as seems most comfortable. Thereupon
the men chosen for that purpose shall present
your errand to the king. And if fortune allows your suit
to prosper immediately according to your wishes, you
shall go to the king’s hand and thereafter enter the
fellowship of the hird according to the customs which
those who plead your case will teach you. But if the
king makes promise and fixes a day when you are to
appear and the matter is to be settled, it must rest till
that time. If the king postpones the decision, saying as
is not unlikely: “I know nothing about this man, either
as to repute or manners, and cannot reply at once to
his request but must first observe clearly his ways of
thinking and doing;” then the matter is closed for the
time being. But you may, if you are so disposed, continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>your suit and try to find a more convenient time,
when your affairs may have a more favorable outcome.
However, while you are seeking to gain the king’s favor,
you will need above all to keep close to the best and
most discreet men, and you should often be seen in the
company of those who are dearest to the king. But pay
all the necessary outlay out of your own means, however
long this probation may last, unless you should
sometime be invited by the king’s order to his tables.
And let it not be true in your case as is true in the case
of many an unwise man, that the more often you find
yourself invited, the more you begin to long for another’s
fare, lest upright men come to regard you as
selfish and impertinent, and those become hostile who
were formerly your friends and comrades. Walk uprightly,
therefore, and be heedful in all such matters,
lest evil befall you through lack of foresight.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>WHY ONE SHOULD NOT WEAR A MANTLE IN THE ROYAL PRESENCE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> If you permit, I will ask to be allowed a few
words in this discussion. On what do you base your
statement that it is considered good deportment among
princes for a man to come bareheaded and without a
mantle when he comes to seek audience with them. If
anyone did thus in the country, the mob would say that
the man was a fool to run about in that way without a
cloak like a ninny.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I told you a little earlier in our conversation
that many a man goes about in ignorance as to what is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>fitting in a king’s house, because many things look stupid
to the multitude which are considered proper in the
presence of kings and other great men. Now you shall
know of a truth, not only that it is fitting to come without
a mantle when one appears for the first time before
a king, but also that in many places it is as proper to
wear one’s mantle in the royal presence as to leave it
off. But since you have asked the reason why it should
seem more decorous to appear before princes without
one’s mantle than to wear it, it might be a more than
sufficient answer to say that it is the custom wherever
well-bred men appear in the presence of mighty lords
to come without a mantle, and that whoever is ignorant
of that custom is there called a churl.</p>

<p class='c010'>But these facts may serve as an additional answer:
if a man appears before magnates wrapped in his cloak,
he shows in that way that he regards himself as an
equal to them in whose presence he is; for he comes
clad in all his finery like a lord, and acts as if he need
not serve any one. But if he lays aside his cloak, he
shows that he is ready for service, if the one who is entitled
to receive rather than to do service is willing to
accept it. Likewise there are instances of this other fact,
which often necessitates caution, that many are envious
of a king; and if his enemy is rash and bold, he can indeed
come before the king with hidden perils and murderous
weapons, if he is allowed to wear his mantle; but
he cannot easily accomplish this if he comes without his
cloak. It is therefore evident that he was a wise man
who first ordained the formality that a man should appear
without a mantle before great lords and especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>before kings. For that custom has since led to greater
security against secret treason which could easily be
hidden under the cloak, if it were worn. The custom
has also promoted fair dealing and concord among men,
for in this matter they all enjoy the same rights; and
this being the accepted custom, one is not suspected or
searched more than others.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XXXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>RULES OF SPEECH AND CONVERSATION IN THE KING’S HALL</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Although this custom seemed strange to me before
I heard your comment, it now looks as if it were
founded on good sense and is not to be dispensed with;
and therefore it will be well if you will continue to recount
and point out to me all the forms of speech and
conduct which one needs to observe in the presence of
kings and other great men.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Keep carefully in mind, while in the king’s
presence, that you ought not to engage in conversation
with other men and thus fail to pay heed to everything
that the king says, lest it happen, if he addresses a remark
to you, that you have to ask what he said. For it
always looks ill for one to be so inattentive that the
words spoken to him must be repeated before he can
hear; and it looks particularly bad in the presence of
important men. Still, it can very often come to pass,
when one is in a lord’s presence, that other men crowd
about him and ask questions of many sorts; sometimes
this is due to the stupidity of those who do thus, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>often the reason may be that he who acts in this way
would not be displeased if something should be found
to be censured in him who has a plea to make.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now if it should happen while you are standing before
a king that some one in the meantime should try
to address a question or other remark to you, have
friendly words ready on your lips and reply in this wise:
“Wait a moment, my good man, while I listen a while
to what the king says; later I shall be pleased to talk
with you as long as you wish.” If he still tries to have
further words with you, speak no more to him then until
the king has finished his remarks. If it now should
happen that the king has a few words to say to you,
be very careful in your answer not to use plural terms
in phrases that refer to yourself, though you do use the
plural, as is proper, in all phrases referring to the king.
But even more you need to beware of what fools frequently
do, namely using the plural in phrases referring
to yourself, while you employ the singular in those that
refer to the king. And if the king should happen to
speak a few words to you which you did not catch, and
you have to ask what he said, do not say “Eh?” or
“What?” or make a fuss about it, but use only the
word “Sire;” or if you prefer to ask in more words:
“My lord, be not offended if I ask what you said to
me, but I did not quite catch it.” But see to it that
it happens in rare cases only that the king need to repeat
his remarks to you more than once before you
grasp them.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXXIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE PROPER USES OF “YOU” AND “THOU”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> On what ground is it thought better to phrase
all remarks addressed to lords in the plural than in the
singular? When one directs a prayer to God, Who is
higher and more excellent than all others, the expressions
that refer to Him are all phrased in the singular;
for everyone who makes his prayer to God speaks in
this wise: “Almighty God, my Lord, hear Thou my
prayer and be Thou more merciful toward me than I
deserve.” But I hear no one form his words in this wise:
“My Lord, hear my prayer and deal better with me
because of Your mercy than I deserve.” Now I am not
sure that my question is a very wise one; still, since you
have allowed me to ask whatever I desire to know, I
shall look for an informing reply as before, even though
I ask like a child.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I shall indeed be glad to explain everything
to you as far as I am able; but I do not see why you are
searching into this matter so closely that one shall even
have to give reasons for the choice of terms in holy
prayer. For the teachers of the church are far better
able to interpret matters that belong to divinity than I.
But since every question looks toward a reply, I shall
explain this to you in a few words, as it seems most
reasonable to me; and I shall take up first what seems
to me the most important. Now I believe the terms used
in sacred prayers are chosen so that we call upon the
divine name in the singular rather than in the plural,
in order that all who believe in God may clearly understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>that we believe in one true God and not in numerous
idols like the heathen who formerly called upon
seven gods. For they held that one god ruled the heavens;
another, the heavenly bodies; a third, the earth
and its fruits; a fourth, the sea and its waters; a fifth, the
air and the winds; a sixth, learning and eloquence; a
seventh, death and hell. Now we should honor the one
true God Whom all creation serves and call upon Him
in singular terms, lest false gods obtain our worship, if
when calling upon the divine name we use plural terms,
as if there were more than one God. There is this added
reason, that simple-minded folk may conclude that
there are more gods than one if His name be invoked in
plural terms. Thus it is rightfully and wisely ordered,
so that a simple and holy faith shall have no cause to
stray away from the true highway. Now if you do not
fully grasp this speech, we shall find more to say; but
if it has led you to clearer insight, we may as well direct
our thoughts to the other matters that you have asked
about.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> These things seem very clear to me and it appears
both reasonable and necessary that one should
use the singular rather than the plural in addressing
God, lest the true faith be debased by the use of plural
expressions and the cunning adversaries obtain the worship
that a simple and true faith refuses them. But
now I wish to have you turn to what I asked about the
mighty men of this world, and explain why it seems
better to address them in plural than in singular terms.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span><i>Father.</i> It might be a sufficient answer to state that
it seems better to address princes in plural than in singular
terms for the reason that well-bred people have found
it so from the beginning; and it has since become a custom
among all discreet and courteous men, and is done
in honor of those who are addressed and are entitled to
a deferential mode of address. But this is the thought
which they had in mind who originated these expressions,
that men of power are not like all others who have
only themselves and their households to care for and
are responsible for a few men only. For chieftains are
responsible for all those who are subject to them in service
or authority, and they have not only one man’s
answer on the tongue but have indeed to answer for
many. And when a good chief departs this life, it is not
as if one man is lost, but it is a great loss to all those who
received support and honors from him; and they seem
to be of less consequence after they have lost their chief
than before while he was living, unless one shall come
into his stead who will be as gracious to them as the
departed one was. Now since great lords both maintain
the honor of many and have great cares and liabilities
on their account, it is surely proper to honor them by
using the plural forms of address in all speech that those
who are humbler and of less consequence may have to
address to them. But there remain those things which
were learned or thought of when this custom was first
ordained: that kings and other powerful men are not
alone in their deliberations but are associated with many
other wise and distinguished men; and therefore, when
a chief is addressed in plural terms, it may be thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>that the words are not addressed to the king alone, but
also to all those who sit in his councils as his advisers.</p>

<p class='c010'>In my last speech I also mentioned that you must
have care never to use the plural in expressions referring
to yourself, lest you seem to regard yourself as on an
equality with the one to whom you are speaking, if he
is of higher rank than you are. And even when you
talk with an equal or with a humbler man than you
are, it is not fitting for you to honor yourself with
plural terms. You must also beware when in the presence
of princes, lest you become too verbose in your talk; for
great lords and all discreet men are displeased with
prolixity and regard it as tedious and worthless folly.
Further, if you have a matter to present, whether it
concerns yourself or others, present it clearly but with
quick utterance and in the fewest possible words; for
constantly there comes before kings and other lords
such a great mass of business respecting the manifold
needs of their subjects, that they have neither time nor
inclination to hear a case discussed in a long, detailed
speech. And it is very evident that, if a man is clever
and fluent in speech, he will find it easy to state his case
in a few rapidly spoken words, so that the one who is
to reply will grasp it readily. Then, too, if one is not an
orator and, even more, is awkward in speech, the briefer
the errand on his tongue, the better it is; for a man can
somehow manage to get through with a few words and
thus conceal his awkwardness from those to whom it is
unknown. But when a man makes an elaborate effort,
he will surely seem the more unskilful the longer he
talks.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Now such things there are and others like them into
which a man, if he wishes to be called well-bred, must
get some insight and which he ought to learn at home
before he goes very often to have conversation with great
lords. And from all this you will see how courtly and
cultured they ought to be in their manners and conduct
who are constantly to be near a king in all manner of
honorable intercourse, since it has appeared to knowing
men as if one is scarcely prepared to come into the king’s
presence to converse with him unless he has mastered
all these things that we have now talked about, except
he should be a perfect boor, and not to be reckoned or
classed among well-bred people but among the very
churls. Still, you must know this, too, that there are
many who have spent a long time at court, and know
but little or nothing about these things. And this is
true of those who bear the hirdman’s name and should
be very close to the king, as well as of those who have
lesser titles and rarely see the king. It must have been
of such as these last mentioned that you spoke earlier
in our conversation when you remarked that those who
came from the court seemed no more polished or cultured,
or even less, than those who had never been at
court. To that I replied, and with truth, that everyone
who wishes to be proper in his conduct needs to guard
against such ignorance as they are guilty of, who know
not the meaning of shame or honor or courtesy, and
learn nothing from the conduct of good and courtly men,
even though they see it daily before their eyes.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>CONCERNING FAILURE OF CROPS AND DEARTH IN MORALS AND GOVERNMENT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It is a fact that I have met some who, though
they came from court, either concealed the sort of manners
that you have now discussed, if they knew them,
or had, as I remarked, never gained insight into such
matters. Now it is not strange that those who remain
at home in ignorance or are not of an inquiring mind
know little or nothing about such things; but it is more
to be wondered at, as you have just said, that many remain
a long time with the king and close to him in service,
and still do not learn either what courtesy means
or what courtly manners are. Therefore, since you have
warned me to beware of such ignorance, I want to ask
you how this can be and how a king who is well-bred
and courteous can be willing to keep men about his person
to serve him, who refuse to live according to good
manners. For I have thought that, if a king is courteous
and refined, all would imitate him in decorum, and that
he would not care much for churlish men.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It may happen sometimes that a husbandman
who is accustomed to eat good bread and clean
food has to mix chaff or bran with his flour so as to make
his bread and that of his household last longer than
common; and at such times he must, though reluctant,
partake of such food as is set before him in the same
thankful spirit as earlier, when he was given good and
clean food; and such cases result from grinding necessity,
that is, from crop failures. But scarcity arises in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>many ways. Sometimes there is dearth of grain, even
when the earth continues to yield grass and straw,
though at times it gives neither. There are times, too,
when the earth gives good and sufficient fruitage, and
yet no one is profited, for dearth is in the air, and bad
weather ruins the crops at harvest time. Sometimes
smut<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c015'><sup>[246]</sup></a> causes trouble, though the crop is plentiful and
the weather good. It can also happen at times that all
vegetation flourishes at its best, and there is no dearth;
and yet there may be great scarcity on some man’s
farm or among his cattle, or in the ocean, or in the fresh
waters, or in the hunting forests. Sometimes when
everything goes wrong, it may even come to pass that
all these failures occur together; and then bran will be
as dear among men as clean flour was earlier, when times
were good, or even dearer than that. All these forms of
dearth which I have now recounted must be regarded
as great calamities in every land where they occur; and
it would mean almost complete ruin if they should all
appear at the same time and continue for a period of
three years.</p>

<p class='c010'>There remains another kind of dearth which alone
is more distressing than all those which I have enumerated:
dearth may come upon the people who inhabit
the land, or, what is worse, there may come failure
in the morals, the intelligence, or the counsels of those
who are to govern the land. For something can be done
to help a country where there is famine, if capable men
are in control and there is prosperity in the neighboring
lands. But if dearth comes upon the people or the morals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>of the nation, far greater misfortunes will arise. For one
cannot buy from other countries with money either
morals or insight, if what was formerly in the land
should be lost or destroyed. But even though there be
failure of harvest on a peasant’s farm, which has always
been good and which he and his kinsmen before him
have owned a long time, he will not take such an angry
dislike to it that, caring no longer what becomes of it,
he will proceed forthwith to dispose of it; much rather
will he plan to garner and store grass and chaff as carefully
as he once garnered good and clean grain, or even
more so, and in this way provide for his household as
best he can, until God wills that times shall improve.
In this way, too, a king must act, if he should suffer the
misfortune of dearth upon the morals or the intelligence
of his realm: he must not renounce the kingdom, but
necessity may force him to rate the men of little wit as
high as the wise were rated earlier while the kingdom
stood highest in prosperity and morals. Sometimes punishment
will serve and sometimes prayer; something
may also be gained through instruction; but the land
must be maintained in every way possible until God
wills that times shall improve.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XXXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE CAUSES OF SUCH PERIODS OF DEARTH AND WHAT FORMS THE DEARTH MAY TAKE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I see clearly now that troubles may befall men
in many ways, the mighty as well as the humble, kings
as well as cotters. But as you have given me this freedom
and have allowed me to question you in our conversation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>I shall ask you to enlarge somewhat fully
upon this speech before we take up another. What is
your opinion as to the causes of such a severe dearth as
may come upon the minds of men, so that all is ruined
at the same time, insight and national morals? And do
you think such losses should be traced to the people
who inhabit the realm or to the king and the men who
manage the state with him?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> What you have now asked about has its origin
in various facts and occurrences of a harmful character.
I believe, however, that such misfortunes would rarely
appear among the people who inhabit and till the land,
if the men who govern the realm were discreet and the
king himself were wise. But when God, because of the
sins of the people, determines to visit a land with a punishment
that means destruction to morals and intellect,
He will carry out His decision promptly, though in various
ways, as soon as He wills it. Instances of this have
occurred frequently and in various places, where trouble
has come when a chieftain, who possessed both wealth
and wisdom and who had been highly honored by the
king, having sat in his council and shared largely with
him in the government, departed this life leaving four
or five sons in his place, all in their early youth or childhood.
Then the king and the whole realm have suffered
immediate injury: the king has lost a good friend, an
excellent adviser, and a strong bulwark. Next the man’s
possessions are divided into five parts, and all his projects
are disturbed. His household sinks in importance,
since each of the sons has but a fifth of all the power
that the father derived from his means while he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>living, and has even less of his insight and knowledge
of manners, being a mere child. Greater still will the
change be if he leaves no son at his decease but as many
daughters as I have now counted sons; but the very
greatest change will come if neither sons nor daughters
survive him; for then it is likely that his possessions will
be split up among distant relatives, unless a near kinsman
be found.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now if many such events should occur at one time
in a kingdom, vigor would disappear from the king’s
council, though he himself be very capable. And if it
should happen (for there are cases of such events as
well as of the others) that a king depart this life and
leave a young son who succeeds to the paternal kingdom,
though a mere child, and young counsellors come
into the places of the old and wise advisers who were
before,—if all these things that we have now recounted
should happen at one time, then it is highly probable
that all the government of the realm would be stricken
with dearth, and that, when the government goes to
ruin, the morals of the nation would also fail to some
extent.</p>

<p class='c010'>There still remains the one contingency which is most
likely to bring on such years of dearth as produce the
greatest evils; and unfortunately there are no fewer
instances of such issues than of those that we have
just mentioned. If a king who has governed a kingdom
should happen to die, and leave behind three or four
sons, and the men who are likely to be made counsellors
be all young and full of temerity, though wealthy and
of good ancestry, since they have sprung from families
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>that formerly conducted the government with the king,—now
if a kingdom should come into such unfortunate
circumstances as have been described, with several heirs
at the same time, and the evil counsel is furthermore
taken to give them all the royal title and dignity, then
that realm must be called a rudderless ship or a decayed
estate; it may be regarded almost as a ruined kingdom,
for it is sown with the worst seeds of famine and the
grains of unpeace. For the petty kings, having rent the
realm asunder, will quickly divide the loyalty of the
people who inhabit the land, both of the rich and of the
poor; and each of these lords will then try to draw friends
about him, as many as he can. Thereupon each will begin
to survey his realm as to population and wealth;
and when he recalls what his predecessor possessed, each
will feel that he has too little. Then the friends, too, of
each one will remind him of and tell about how much
the king who ruled before him possessed in wealth and
numbers and what great undertakings he set out upon;
and it seems as if in every suggestion each one tries to
urge his lord to seize upon more than he already has.
After that these lords begin to treasure those riches that
are of the least profit to the kingdom, namely envy:
trivial matters are carefully garnered and great wrath
is blown out of them. Soon the love of kinship begins to
decay; he who was earlier called friend and relative is
now looked upon as an evil-doer, for soon each one begins
to be suspicious of the others. But when suspicion
and evil rumors begin to appear, wicked men think that
good times are at hand, and they all bring out their
plows. Before long the seeds of hostility begin to sprout,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>avarice and iniquity flourish, and men grow bold in
manslaying, high-handed robbery, and theft.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now if it happens that one of these princes should
wish to punish the aforesaid vices in his kingdom, the
wicked take refuge in the service of some other master;
and, though they have been driven from home because
of their misdeeds, they pretend to have come in innocence
to escape the cruel wrath of their lord. The one to
whom they have fled gives protection in temerity rather
than in mercy; for he wishes to acquire friends in the
other’s realm, who may prove useful to himself and
hostile to the other in case they should come to disagreement.
But those who had to flee because of their
evil conduct and law-breaking soon begin to show hostility
toward the lord whose subjects they formerly
were and to rouse as much enmity as they can between
him and the one to whom they have come. They take
revenge for their exile by carrying murder, rapine, and
plundering into the kingdom, as if they were guiltless
and all the blame lay with the lord. Soon immorality
begins to multiply, for God shows His wrath in this
way, that where the four boundaries of the territories
of these chiefs touch, he places a moving wheel which
turns on a restless axle. After that each one forgets all
brotherly love, and kinship is wrecked. Nothing is now
spared, for whenever the people are divided into many
factions through loyalty to different chiefs, and these
fall out, the masses will rashly pursue their desires, and
the morals of the nation go to ruin. For then everyone
makes his own moral code according to his own way of
thinking; and no one fears punishment any longer when
the rulers fall out and are weakened thereby.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>When each one looks only to his own tricks and wiles,
great misfortunes of all kinds will come upon the land.
Murder and quarrels will multiply; many women will
be carried off as captives of war and violated, while
others will be ensnared and seduced into fornication;
children will be begotten in adultery and unlawful co-habitation.
Some take their kinswomen or sisters-in-law,
while others seduce wives away from their husbands;
and thus all forms of whoredom are committed and degeneracy
will come to light in all the generations that
are begotten in such immorality. Every form of crime
will be committed. Peasants and subjects become defiant
and disobedient; they are not careful to avoid
crimes, and though they commit many, they atone for
few only. Trusting in their own strength and numbers,
they attend seditious meetings; and they choose as
their part what is likely to bring a dangerous outcome,
for they place all men on the same level, the discreet
and decent ones with the coarse and stupid, and they
screen foolish and iniquitous men from punishment,
though these deserve it every day. And this they do
either by swearing falsely and giving false witness in
their behalf, or by making a foolhardy and crafty defence
at the court of trial, so that the guilty have to
answer for nothing before the kingsmen who assist the
king in carrying out the law. For the unthinking mob
seem to imagine that the king was appointed to be their
opponent; and a foolish man regards himself fortunate
and highly favored in the eyes of thoughtless people, if
he can maintain himself for some time in opposition to
royal authority and the prescriptions of law. And if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>such men have disputes to settle anywhere, the wicked
will support the foolish one, so that he may prevail in
the controversy; thus the upright and the peaceful are
robbed of their dues. If the greedy or the quarrelsome
is slain because of his avarice, his stupid kinsmen who
survive him will feel that their family has been greatly
injured and impaired thereby; and if at some earlier time
there was slain one of their family who was both wise
and peaceful, and whose wisdom and even temper
proved useful to many, and if this one was atoned for
with a payment to the kindred, they will now ask as
large a fine for the unwise as what was formerly taken
for the prudent one; otherwise there will be revenge by
manslaying.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when God sees that such misjudgments, born of
perversity and unwisdom, are decreed, He turns the injustice
back upon those who first began to pass unfair
and unfounded judgments. For as soon as the foolish or
the avaricious sees that he is held in high regard, even
more than the wise with his even temper, and that his
avarice and folly are turned to honor and advancement,
he will do according to his nature and the custom of all
foolish men: he will become more grasping and will
operate more widely in his greed. And when the mob
begins to regard that as worthy of praise and renown
which is evil and should be hated by all, the second
and the third will learn it and the one after the other,
until it becomes common custom; and he alone will be
counted a worthy man who is grasping and knows how
to detract unjustly from another’s honor to his own
profit. After that the one deals greedily with the other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>till misfortune turns against the very ones whose folly
and wickedness originally began these evil practices.
For one will finally bring evil upon another, wounds or
other afflictions, and thus all old and lawful ordinances
must decay. Now everyone holds that the king and
other great lords should temper the severity of the laws
with mercy; but none of the commoners seems willing
to deal justly with another; indeed, each would rather
demand more than what he was entitled to from the
beginning. But when all lawful ordinances and right
punishments are ignored and unlaw and malice take
their place, and this condition becomes so general that
God is wearied, He applies the punishment that is able
to reach all, since the guilt has touched all. He throws
hatred and enmity down among the chiefs who are
placed in control of the realm; when things go ill there
may also come failure of crops; and the chiefs soon begin
to quarrel, for each finds complaints in the other’s kingdom,
which are finally settled with slaughter and strife.</p>

<p class='c010'>But whenever famine, murder, and warfare begin to
arrive together and visit all those who inhabit the realm,
the kingdom will be brought near to utter weakness and
ruin, if the period should continue any length of time.
Though laws and useful customs may have been observed
and maintained to some extent in the times mentioned
earlier, they will be wholly forgotten whenever
such times appear as those that we have just now described;
for in warfare the best men and those of the
noblest kinship are destroyed. But failure of crops,
rapine, and unpeace of every sort that may then appear
will rob those of wealth who are in possession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>it and have acquired it honestly, while he gets it who can
most readily deprive others by theft and plunder. And
when such a time comes upon a nation, it will suffer
loss in good morals and capable men, wealth and security,
and every blessing as long as God permits the
plague to continue. But He metes out according to His
mercy, for He is able to save such a country, when He
finds that the people have been sufficiently chastised
for their sins. Now you can imagine how highly moral
the people will become, if such a nation is saved by God’s
grace and again brought under the rule of a single
monarch, and how prosperous the realm may become
in the period immediately following such an unrest as
I have just described. For then the kingdom was rent,
the morals of the people were confused, and their loyalty
was divided among a number of lords, each one of whom
was striving to contrive and employ against the others
cunning, deception, disloyalty, and evil in every form.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c015'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE DUTIES, ACTIVITIES, AND AMUSEMENTS OF THE ROYAL GUARDSMEN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It is perfectly evident that if all these misfortunes
should befall a kingdom and the period of trouble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>were to continue for some time, the realm would decline.
There surely must be instances of such an issue, and we
may safely conclude that wherever such events come to
pass, there will be much evil and manifold misfortunes
before they cease. I also see clearly that if the morals or
laws of a kingdom are undermined by such troubles as
you have described, even though God should purpose to
rescue it finally from distress and unpeace and bring
it again under one ruler after such troublous times, the
people who survive are likely to be both wicked and
vicious; and there will surely be need, as you have said,
of good instruction and at times even of very severe
punishment. Furthermore, even if the kingdom did possess
tolerable morals for a time before the unpeace came,
he who is to undertake the government, though he be
very wise, will need to use great determination and
severity for a long period, if the realm is to be replaced
on its earlier footing.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have been deeply interested in your discussion of
what may bring the greatest damage to a kingdom (and
it may be rendered worthless through loss of morals,
population, and wealth, if such conditions should arise);
and I have now been sufficiently informed as to how
matters may shape themselves, if misfortune means to
come; and I see clearly what great losses and damage
may follow such events. Now it seems to me that we
have dwelt rather long upon facts which must bring distress
to everyone who wishes to be reputed a moral man
(wherefore all, both rich and poor, should implore the
Lord to let no such times come in their days), and I will
therefore return to what I began with and ask you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>point out the manners and customs which you think
would be becoming to me, if I were employed in the
royal service, no matter what times might come, though
I will pray the Lord that as long as I live there may be
peace and quiet and prosperous times.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> No one knows how God will order such things
during the days of any man’s lifetime. But if a man
determines to be a kingsman and there happens to be
much distress and many disasters at the time because
of too many rulers or unpeace in some form, he must
be careful to join the service of the one who has obtained
the power in the most legal manner and is most likely
to observe the customs that rightful and well-bred kings
have observed before his day. He is then least likely to
incur danger in accounting for his service, whether he
be called to account in this world or in the next. But
you have asked what customs you should observe if you
were bound to a royal service, and on that point I can
very well inform you.</p>

<p class='c010'>This should be the first principle of all your conduct,
never to let your heart be wanting in reverence and
fear of God, to love him above everything else, and next
to him to love righteousness. Train yourself to be fair,
upright, and temperate in all things. Always keep in
mind the day of death and guard carefully against vices.
Remember that many a man lives but a brief time,
while his deeds live long after him; and it is of great
importance what is remembered about him. Some have
reached fame through good deeds, and these always
live after them, for one’s honor lives forever, though
the man himself be dead. Some win fame by evil deeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>and these men, though they be dead, bear a burden of
lasting disgrace when their deeds are recalled; their
kinsmen, too, and all their descendants after their days
have to bear the same dishonor. Those, however, are
most numerous who drop away like cattle and are remembered
neither for good nor for evil; but you shall
know of a truth that such is surely not the purpose of
mankind; for all other creatures were made for the
pleasure and subsistence of man, while man was created
to enjoy the glories of both this and the other world, if
he is to realize the purpose of his creation. Every one,
therefore, while he still lives, should strive to leave a
few such deeds after him as will cause him to be remembered
with favor after he has departed this life.
But this is above all the duty of kings and other mighty
chiefs and of all those who seek their society and enter
their service; for after that a man is no longer looked
upon as a churl, but is honored as a governor or a chief;
and thus he ought to be honored, if he strives to observe
the customs that are becoming to himself and his dignity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take heed lest you vacillate in friendship among
several chiefs, as fickle men do; for no one who acts thus
can be firm in purpose. Love your lord highly and without
guile as long as you stay in his service, and never
seek the society or the confidence of his enemies, if you
wish to remain a man of honor. Above your lord you
must love God alone, but no other man. These are the
things that you must especially avoid, lest they bring
you an evil name: perjury and false testimony, brothels,
drinking bouts, except in the king’s house or in decent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>gatherings, casting dice for silver, lust after bribes, and
all other evil covetousness; for these things are a great
disgrace to every kingsman in this world and his soul
will be in peril in the other world, if he is found guilty
of such vices. Never get drunk, wherever you are; for
it may fall out at any time that you will be summoned
to hear a dispute or to supervise something, or that
you will have important business of your own to look
after. Now if such demands should come to a man while
he is drunk, he will be found wholly incompetent;
wherefore drunkenness should be avoided by everyone,
and most of all by kingsmen and others who wish to be
reputed as worthy men, for such are most frequently
called to hear suits at law and to other important duties.
Moreover, they ought to set good examples for all, as
some may wish to learn decorum from their behavior.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you are a kingsman you must observe the same
prudence in your address and habits, and do not forget
this. You should frequently be seen in your lord’s
presence. Early in the morning you must escort him to
church, if he observes that custom, as by right he ought
to do; listen attentively to the service while you are in
the church, and call devoutly upon God for mercy.
When the king leaves the church, join him at once and
keep sufficiently near him to be in sight, so that he may
be able to call you for any purpose, if he should wish to
do so. But do not keep so close to him as to make him
feel annoyed by your presence, when he wishes to speak
with men whom he has called to converse with him, or
to discuss such matters as he wishes to keep secret.
Never show an interest in those affairs which you see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>that your lord wishes to keep to himself, unless he summons
you to share knowledge with him. But if anything
should come up that your lord confides to you but wishes
to have kept secret, keep it carefully in discreet silence;
do not babble about such affairs as should be hidden in
your fidelity.</p>

<p class='c010'>You must also make a habit of going to the royal
apartments early in the morning before the king has
arisen; but be sure to come carefully washed and bathed
and wearing your best raiment; and wait near the king’s
chamber until he has arisen. Go into the king’s chamber
if he calls you, but at no other time; but wherever
it is that the king summons you, you must come into
his presence without your mantle. If it is early in the
morning and you have not seen him before, wish him
a good day in the words that I have already taught you;
but approach only so near as to leave him sufficient
room to confer with the men who are nearest to him,
and remain standing there. But if he calls you to come
nearer, wishing to speak with you in private, then kneel
before him but only so near that you can readily hear
his words; and come without your mantle. However, if
he invites you to be seated, you may put on your cloak,
if you like, and be seated where he indicates.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now when it happens that the king goes out to seek
diversion, whether it be in town or in the country, or
wherever he is sojourning, and you and your comrades
accompany him, the retinue looks best, whether you
are armed or not, if you walk in equal numbers on either
side of the king, though never in compact groups.
Wherever you go he should walk in your midst, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>you and your companions should be arranged in equal
numbers before and behind him and on either side. But
none of you must walk so near the king that he has not
sufficient space to converse with those whom he summons
to him, whether he wishes to speak with them
openly or in private. And even though he call no one to
have speech with him, keep the order such that there is
plenty of space around him on all sides. But when the
king rides out for amusement and you and your comrades
accompany him, arrange the order of riding in the
way that I have suggested about your walking; only
keep at a greater distance, so that no dirt can splash
from your horses upon the king, even though you ride
quite rapidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the king should call you by name, be careful not
to answer by “Eh?” or “Hm?” or “What?” but
rather speak in this wise: “Yes, my lord, I am glad to
listen!” Also take good heed not to rush away early
in the morning to eat and drink with greedy and unmannerly
men. Wait, as custom demands, till the king’s
meal time, and take your seat at the royal tables, whenever
you are present at court. But when the king sits
down to eat with his hirdmen, these ought all to observe
good manners and decent order, and the one should
never run in ahead of the other like an ill-bred man;
but each ought to know his right place and table companion;
and the men should sit at the table in the same
order as when they are out walking. The men should
go by twos, those who sit together, to lave their hands,
whether the washing is done within the hall or without,
and then to the table, each in the order and to the seat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>that he knows was assigned to him in the beginning.
The hirdmen ought to speak in a low tone at the table
so that not a single word will be heard by those who
sit on either side of the two who wish to converse; let
each one speak to his partner so softly that none shall
hear but those who are conversing; then there will be
good deportment and quiet in the king’s hall. You may,
however, partake freely and quickly of both the food
and the drink on the table according to your needs without
suffering any discredit to your manners; but always
take good heed not to get drunk. You should cast frequent
glances toward the king’s seat to see how his
service is going forward, and always note carefully when
the king raises the beaker to his lips, for you must not
eat while he is drinking. If you have a cup in your hand,
set it down and do not drink just then. You must show
the queen everywhere the same honor as you show the
king according as I have told you. And if the king has
a guest at his table who ought to be shown the same
deference, whether he be a king, an earl, an archbishop,
or a bishop, you should observe these same customs
which I have just taught you. However, if the number
of distinguished people at the royal table should be
large, you need not observe this custom as to drinking
unless you wish, except when the king or the queen
drinks, or when there is another king at the table with
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now if the king’s hirdmen happen to be seated together
in the royal hall but with no tables before them
and certain lords come in whom the king is pleased to
receive with honor, it is the duty of all men to rise before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>them just as before their own lords and to give
them such cordial greetings as they know that the king
desires. But this is an honor which every kingsman owes
to his fellows: when one who has been absent comes in
and walks toward the seat where he has his proper place
and position, the two who sit nearest to him on either
side should rise, receive him in a friendly manner, and
bid him welcome among them. Wherever the kingsmen
are much in the eyes of other men, whether they sit
together at a feast, or walk in the king’s escort, or go
out together to make merry, they ought always to
speak in rather low tones, to be proper in their actions
and elegant in their speech, and to avoid all indecent
talk. All these rules which I have now recounted must
be learned and observed by all kingsmen who wish to
be known for good breeding. But no matter how others
behave, be sure that you observe carefully all that I
have taught you, and be willing to teach others who
may wish to learn from you.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now if your comrades are planning to go from the
king’s apartments to some drinking bout or other merrymaking,
and you, too, have the king’s permission to
seek diversion, you should prefer the forms of amusement
which I shall now point out to you. If you are sojourning
where horses may be ridden and you have your
own horse, put on heavy armor and, mounting your
horse, train yourself in the art of sitting on horseback
in the firmest and most handsome manner. Train yourself
to press the foot firmly into the stirrup; keep your
leg stiff and the heel a little lower than the toes, except
when you have to guard against thrusts from the front;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and practice sitting firmly with the thighs pressed close.
Cover your breast and limbs carefully with a curved
shield. Train your left hand to grasp firmly the bridle
and the grip of the shield, and your right hand to direct
the spear-thrust so that all your bodily strength will
support it. Train your good steed to veer about when
in full gallop; keep him clean and in good condition;
keep him shod firmly and well, and provide him with a
strong and handsome harness.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if you are in a borough or some such place where
horses cannot be used for recreation, you should take
up this form of amusement: go to your chambers and
put on heavy armor; next look up some fellow henchman
(he may be a native or an alien) who likes to drill
with you and whom you know to be well trained to
fight behind a shield or a buckler. Always bring heavy
armor to this exercise, either chain mail or a thick gambison,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c015'><sup>[248]</sup></a>
and carry a heavy sword and a weighty shield
or buckler in your hand. In this game you should strive
to learn suitable thrusts and such counterstrokes as are
good, necessary, and convenient. Learn precisely how
to cover yourself with the shield, so that you may be
able to guard well when you have to deal with a foeman.
If you feel that it is important to be well trained in these
activities, go through the exercise twice a day, if it is
convenient; but let no day pass, except holidays, without
practicing this drill at least once; for it is counted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>proper for all kingsmen to master this art and, moreover,
it must be mastered if it is to be of service. If the
drill tires you and makes you thirsty, drink a little now
and then, enough to quench your thirst; but while the
game is on, be careful not to drink till you are drunk or
even merry.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you should like to try a variety of drills and pastimes,
there are certain sports that one can take up out
of doors, if that is thought more diverting. For one
thing, you may have a pole prepared, somewhat heavier
than a spear shaft, and put up a mark some distance
away for a target; with these you can determine how far
and how accurately you can throw a spear and do it effectively.
It is also counted rare sport and pastime to take
one’s bow and go with other men to practice archery.
Another pleasant and useful diversion is to practice
throwing with a sling both for distance and for accuracy,
and with a staff sling<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c015'><sup>[249]</sup></a> as well as with a hand sling, and
to practice throwing stone missiles. Formerly the custom
was for all who wished to become expert in such
arts and thoroughly proficient in war and chivalry to
train both hands alike to the use of weapons. Strive
after the same skill, if you find yourself gifted for it,
inasmuch as those who are trained in that way are the
most perfect in these activities and the most dangerous
to their enemies.</p>

<p class='c010'>You should abhor and avoid manslaying in every
form except as a lawful punishment or in common warfare.
But in ordinary warfare on the lawful command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>of your chief, you need to shun manslaying no more
than any other deed which you know to be right and
good. Show courage and bravery in battle; fight with
proper and effective blows, such as you have already
learned, as if in the best of humor, though filled with
noble wrath. Never fight with feigned strokes, needless
thrusts, or uncertain shots like a frightened man. Heed
these things well that you may be able to match your
opponent’s skill in fighting. Be resolute in combat but
not hot-headed and least of all boastful. Always remember
that there may be those who can give good
testimony in your behalf; but never praise your own
deeds, lest after a time it should come to pass that you
are pursued for the slaughter of men whose death is
rated a great loss and the revenge is directed toward
you by your own words.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you are fighting on foot in a land battle and are
placed at the point of a wedge-shaped column,<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c015'><sup>[250]</sup></a> it is
very important to watch the closed shield line in the
first onset, lest it become disarranged or broken. Take
heed never to bind the front edge of your shield under
that of another.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c015'><sup>[251]</sup></a> You must also be specially careful,
when in the battle line, never to throw your spear, unless
you have two, for in battle array on land one spear
is more effective than two swords. But if the fight is on
shipboard, select two spears which are not to be thrown,
one with a shaft long enough to reach easily from ship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>to ship and one with a shorter shaft, which you will find
particularly serviceable when you try to board the
enemy’s ship. Various kinds of darts should be kept on
ships, both heavy javelins and lighter ones. Try to
strike your opponent’s shield with a heavy javelin, and
if the shield glides aside, attack him with a light javelin,
unless you are able to reach him with a long-shafted
spear. Fight on sea as on land with an even temper and
with proper strokes only; and never waste your weapons
by hurling them to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Weapons of many sorts may be used to advantage on
shipboard, which one has no occasion to use on land,
except in a fortress or castle. Longhandled scythes<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c015'><sup>[252]</sup></a> and
long-shafted broadaxes,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c015'><sup>[253]</sup></a> “war-beams” and staff slings,
darts,<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c015'><sup>[254]</sup></a> and missiles of every sort are serviceable on
ships. Crossbows and longbows are useful as well as all
other forms of shooting weapons; but coal and sulphur<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c015'><sup>[255]</sup></a>
are, however, the most effective munitions of all that I
have named. Caltrops<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c015'><sup>[256]</sup></a> cast in lead and good halberds<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c015'><sup>[257]</sup></a>
are also effective weapons on shipboard. A tower joined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>to the mast<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c015'><sup>[258]</sup></a> will be serviceable along with these and
many other defenses, as is also a beam cloven into four
parts and set with prongs of hard steel,<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c015'><sup>[259]</sup></a> which is drawn
up against the mast. A “prow-boar”<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c015'><sup>[260]</sup></a> with an ironclad
snout is also useful in naval battles. But it is well for
men to be carefully trained in handling these before
they have to use them; for one knows neither the time
nor the hour when he shall have to make use of any
particular kind of weapons. But take good heed to collect
as many types of weapons as possible, while you
still have no need of them; for it is always a distinction
to have good weapons, and, furthermore, they are a
good possession in times of necessity when one has to
use them. For a ship’s defense the following arrangement
is necessary: it should be fortified strongly with
beams and logs built up into a high rampart, through
which there should be four openings, each so large and
wide that one or two men in full armor can leap through
them; but outside and along the rampart on both sides
of the ship there should be laid a level walk of planks
to stand upon.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c015'><sup>[261]</sup></a> This breastwork must be firmly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>carefully braced so that it cannot be shaken though
one leaps violently upon it. Wide shields and chain mail
of every sort are good defensive weapons on shipboard;
the chief protection, however, is the gambison made of
soft linen thoroughly blackened, good helmets, and low
caps of steel. There are many other weapons that can
be used in naval fights, but it seems needless to discuss
more than those which I have now enumerated.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XXXVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>WEAPONS FOR OFFENSE AND DEFENSE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Since we now have before us a discussion which
teaches chiefly how a man must prepare himself to meet
his enemies in attack and defense, it seems to me that
it would be well to say something about how one has
to fight on land, on horse or on foot, and in attacking
and defending castles. Therefore, if you feel disposed
to say anything about such matters, I shall be glad to
listen.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The man who is to fight on horseback needs
to make sure, as we have already stated, that he is
thoroughly trained in all the arts of mounted warfare.
For his horse he will need to provide this equipment:<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c015'><sup>[262]</sup></a>
he must keep him carefully and firmly shod; he must
also make sure that the saddle is strong, made with high
bows, and provided with strong girths and other saddlegear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>including a durable surcingle across the middle
and a breast strap in front.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c015'><sup>[263]</sup></a> The horse should be protected
in such a way both in front of the saddle and behind
it that he will not be exposed to weapons, spear-thrust
or stroke, or any other form of attack. He should
also have a good shabrack<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c015'><sup>[264]</sup></a> made like a gambison of
soft and thoroughly blackened linen cloth, for this is a
good protection against all kinds of weapons. It may be
decorated as one likes, and over the shabrack there
should be a good harness of mail. With this equipment
every part of the horse should be covered, head, loins,
breast, belly, and the entire beast, so that no man, even if
on foot, shall be able to reach him with deadly weapons.
The horse should have a strong bridle, one that can be
gripped firmly and used to rein him in or throw him when
necessary. Over the bridle and about the entire head of
the horse and around the neck back to the saddle, there
should be a harness made like a gambison of firm linen
cloth, so that no man shall be able to take away the
bridle or the horse by stealth.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c015'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>The rider himself should be equipped in this wise:
he should wear good soft breeches made of soft and
thoroughly blackened linen cloth, which should reach
up to the belt; outside these, good mail hose<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c015'><sup>[266]</sup></a> which
should come up high enough to be girded on with a
double strap; over these he must have good trousers
made of linen cloth of the sort that I have already
described; finally, over these he should have good kneepieces
made of thick iron and rivets hard as steel.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c015'><sup>[267]</sup></a> Above
and next to the body he should wear a soft gambison,
which need not come lower than to the middle of the
thigh. Over this he must have a strong breastplate<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c015'><sup>[268]</sup></a>
made of good iron covering the body from the nipples to
the trousers belt; outside this, a well-made hauberk and
over the hauberk a firm gambison made in the manner
which I have already described but without sleeves. He
must have a dirk<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c015'><sup>[269]</sup></a> and two swords, one girded on and
another hanging from the pommel of the saddle. On his
head he must have a dependable helmet made of good
steel and provided with a visor.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c015'><sup>[270]</sup></a> He must also have a
strong, thick shield fastened to a durable shoulder belt
and, in addition, a good sharp spear with a firm shaft
and pointed with fine steel. Now it seems needless to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>speak further about the equipment of men who fight
on horseback; there are, however, other weapons which
a mounted warrior may use, if he wishes; among these
are the “horn bow”<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c015'><sup>[271]</sup></a> and the weaker crossbow, which
a man can easily draw even when on horseback, and
certain other weapons, too, if he should want them.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c006' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XXXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MILITARY ENGINES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Inasmuch as you seem to think that you have
described most of the weapons which are convenient to
have in naval warfare or in fighting on horseback, I will
now ask you to say something about those which you
think are most effective in besieging or defending castles.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> All the weapons that we have just discussed
as useful on ships or on horseback can also be used in
attacking and defending castles; but there are many
other kinds. If one is to attack a castle with the weapons
which I have enumerated, he will also have need of
trebuckets:<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c015'><sup>[272]</sup></a> a few powerful ones with which to throw
large rocks against stone walls to determine whether
they are able to resist such violent blows, and weaker
trebuckets for throwing missiles over the walls to demolish
the houses within the castle. But if one is unable
to break down or shatter a stone wall with trebuckets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>he will have to try another engine, namely the iron-headed
ram,<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c015'><sup>[273]</sup></a> for very few stone walls can withstand
its attack. If this engine fails to batter down or shake
the wall, it may be advisable to set the cat<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c015'><sup>[274]</sup></a> to work.
A tower raised on wheels<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c015'><sup>[275]</sup></a> is useful in besieging castles,
if it is constructed so that it rises above the wall which
is to be stormed, even though the difference in height
be only seven ells; but the higher it is, the more effective
it will be in attacking another tower. Scaling ladders on
wheels which may be moved backward and forward are
also useful for this purpose, if they are boarded up underneath
and have good ropes on both sides. And we
may say briefly about this craft, that in besieging castles
use will be found for all sorts of military engines. But
whoever wishes to join in this must be sure that he
knows precisely even to the very hour when he shall
have need for each device.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those who have to defend a castle may also make use
of these weapons which I have now enumerated and
many more: trebuckets both large and small, hand
slings and staff slings. They will find crossbows and
other bows, too, very effective, as well as every other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>type of shooting weapons, such as spears and javelins
both light and heavy. But to resist the trebuckets,
the cat, and the engine called the ram, it is well to
strengthen the entire stone wall on the inside with
large oaken timbers; though if earth and clay are plentiful,
these materials had better be used. Those who
have to defend castles are also in the habit of making
curtains of large oak boughs, three or even five deep,
to cover the entire wall;<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c015'><sup>[276]</sup></a> and the curtain should be
thoroughly plastered with good sticky clay. To defeat
the attacks of the ram, men have sometimes filled large
bags with hay or straw and lowered them with light
iron chains in front of the ram where it sought to pierce
the wall. It sometimes happens that the shots fall so
rapidly upon a fortress that the defenders are unable
to remain at the battlements; it is then advisable to
hang out brattices made of light planks and built high
enough to reach two ells above the openings in the parapet
and three ells below them. They should be wide
enough to enable the men to fight with any sort of
weapons between the parapet and the brattice wall, and
they should be hung from slender beams in such a way
that they may be readily drawn in and hung out again
later, as one may wish.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c015'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The “hedgehog”<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c015'><sup>[278]</sup></a> will be found an effective device
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>in defending a castle. It is made of large, heavy beams
armed along the ridge with a brush of pointed oak nails;
it is hung outside the parapet to be dropped on anyone
who comes too near the wall. Turnpikes made of large
heavy logs armed with sharp teeth of hard oak may be
raised on end near the battlements and kept ready to
be dropped upon those who approach the castle. Another
good device is the “briar,”<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c015'><sup>[279]</sup></a> which is made of
good iron and has curved thorns as hard as steel with
a barb on every thorn; and the chain, from which it
hangs, as high up as a man can reach must be made of
spiked links, so that it can be neither held nor hewn;
higher up any kind of rope that seems suitable may be
used, only, it must be firm and strong. This briar is
thrown down among the enemy in the hope of catching
one or more of them and then it is pulled up again. A
“running wheel”<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c015'><sup>[280]</sup></a> is also a good weapon for those who
defend castles: it is made of two millstones with an
axle of tough oak joining them. Planks sloping downward
are laid out through the openings in the wall; the
wheel is rolled out upon these and then down upon the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>A “shot wagon”<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c015'><sup>[281]</sup></a> is also a good device. This is made
like any other wagon with two or four wheels as one
likes and is intended to carry a load of stones, hot or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>cold as one may prefer. It must also be provided with
two firm and strong chains, one on each side, which can
be depended on to check the wagon even where it has
a long track to run upon. It is meant to run on planks
set with a downward slope, but one must be careful to
keep the wheels from skidding off the planks. When the
chains check the speed, the wagon shoots its load out
upon the men below. The more uneven the stones are,
some large and some small, the more effective the load
will be. Canny men, who are set to defend a wall and
wish to throw rocks down upon the attacking line or
upon the penthouse, make these rocks of clay with
pebbles, slingstones, and other hard stones placed inside.
The clay is burned hard enough on the outside to
endure the flight while the load is being thrown; but as
soon as the rocks fall they break into fragments and
consequently cannot be hurled back again. To break
down stone walls, however, large, hard rocks are required.
Similarly, when one hurls missiles from a stone
fortress against an opposing wooden tower or upon the
axletrees which support siege engines, towers, scaling
ladders, cats, or any other engine on wheels, the larger
and harder the rocks that are used, the more effective
they will be.</p>

<p class='c010'>Boiling water, molten glass, and molten lead are also
useful in defending walls.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c015'><sup>[282]</sup></a> But if a cat or any other
covered engine which cannot be damaged by hot water
is being pushed toward a castle, it is a good plan, if the
engine is lower than the walls, to provide beams carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>shod with iron underneath and in addition armed
with large, sharp, red-hot plowshares. These are to be
thrown down upon the wooden engine in which the
plowshares are likely to stick fast, while the beams may
be hoisted up again. This attack should be followed up
with pitch, sulphur, or boiling tar.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c015'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Mines dug in the neighborhood of a castle are also
an excellent protection; the deeper and narrower they
are, the better it is; and where men are shoving mounted
engines toward the walls, it were well if there were many
mines. All mines should have a number of small openings,
which must be covered so as not to be visible on the
surface. They should be filled with fuel of the most inflammable
sort, peat or anything else that burns readily.
When a castle is attacked at night either from wooden
towers or with scaling ladders or any other engine on
wheels, the defenders should steal out and fire the
mines.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c015'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Now if it should happen that the enemy’s stones
come over the battlements with such violence that the
men cannot remain in the open to defend the wall, it is
a good plan to set up strong posts cut from thick oak
and to lay large and tough cross beams upon these,
then to roof the whole over with firm oak timbers, and
finally to cover the roofing with a layer of earth not less
than three or four ells in depth, upon which the rocks
may be allowed to drop.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c015'><sup>[285]</sup></a> In like manner the attack of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>a wooden tower that is moving toward a castle may be
foiled by setting up strong, firm posts rising considerably
higher than the attacking tower. But a more effective
contrivance than all the engines that I have now
described is a stooping shield-giant which breathes forth
flame and fire.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c015'><sup>[286]</sup></a> And now we shall close our account of
the engines that are useful in defending castle walls with
the reminder that every sort of weapon with which one
can shoot, hurl, hew, or thrust, and every kind that
can be used in attack or defense may be brought into
service.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XL<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE PROPER MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF A ROYAL COURT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Since you seem to think that sufficient has been
said about weapons both for attack and defense, how
they should be made or built, and on what occasion each
kind should be used (and after your comments these
things are very clear to me), I now wish to ask whether
there may not be other subjects which you think ought
to be discussed, such as pertain to customs that one
must observe in the presence of great men or at royal
courts.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> There still remain a number of things which
a man should not fail to hear discussed and to reflect
upon, if he is to attend on kings or other magnates and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>wishes to be ranked among them as a worthy man. But
there are three things (which are, however, almost the
same in reality) which one must observe with care: they
are wisdom, good breeding, and courtesy. It is courtesy
to be friendly, humble, ready to serve, and elegant in
speech; to know how to behave properly while conversing
or making merry with other men; to know precisely,
when a man is conversing with women, whether they
be young or older in years, of gentle or humble estate,
how to select such expressions as are suited to their rank
and are as proper for them to hear as for him to use. In
like manner when one speaks with men, whether they
be young or old, gentle or humble, it is well to know how
to employ fitting words and how to determine what expressions
are proper for each one to take note of. Even
when mere pleasantry is intended, it is well to choose
fair and decent words. It is also courtesy to know how
to discriminate in language, when to use plural and when
to use singular forms in addressing the men with whom
one is conversing; to know how to select one’s clothes
both as to color and other considerations; and to know
when to stand or sit, when to rise or kneel. It is also
courtesy to know when a man ought to let his hands
drop gently and to keep them quiet, or when he ought
to move them about in service for himself or for others;
to know in what direction to turn his face and breast,
and how to turn his back and shoulders. It is courtesy
to know precisely when he is free to wear his cloak, hat,
or coif, if he has one, and when these are not to be worn;
also to know, when at the table, whether good breeding
demands that one must watch the great men partake of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>food, or whether one may eat and drink freely in any
way that seems convenient and proper. It is also courtesy
to refrain from sneers and contemptuous jests, to
know clearly what churlishness is and to avoid it carefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is good breeding to be agreeable and never obstinate
when one is with other men, and to be modest in
demeanor; to walk a proper gait when on foot and to
watch one’s limbs carefully wherever one goes to make
sure that each will move correctly and yet in a natural
way. It is good breeding, too, when one strolls about
in a city among strangers, to keep silence and use few
words, to shun turmoil and disgraceful tippling, to punish
theft and robbery and all other foolish rioting. It is
also good breeding to avoid profanity, cursing, scolding,
and all other pernicious talk. Be careful also never to
appear as the advocate of stupid and dishonest men and
especially not to support them in their impudence, but
rather to show hatred for wickedness in every form. It is
good breeding to shun chess and dice, brothels and perjury,
false testimony, and other lasciviousness or filthy
behavior. It shows good breeding to be cleanly in food
and clothes; to take good care of the ships, horses,
weapons, and buildings that one may possess; to be cautious
and never rash and to be undismayed in times of
stress; never to be ostentatious, domineering, or envious;
and to shun arrogance and affectation in every form. But
the chief point in all conduct is to love God and holy
church, to hear mass regularly, to be diligent in divine
service, and to implore mercy for oneself and all other
Christian people.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>No one can attain to all these virtues which we have
now enumerated as belonging to courtesy and good
breeding, unless he is also endowed with wisdom. These
gifts will accompany wisdom: elegance in speech, eloquence,
insight into proper conduct, and ability to discriminate
between good manners and what passes for
such in the sayings of foolish men, though they are in
fact bad manners. It is also wisdom, when one is present
at the law court, or some other place where men congregate,
and hears the speeches and the suits of men, to be
able to discern clearly what suits or what speeches delivered
there are based on reason and which ones are
merely glib palaver and senseless verbosity. It is also
wisdom to have a clear appreciation, when decrees are
rendered in the disputes of men, of how these are stated,
so that not a word will be added or taken away, if one
should need to know them at some later time. It is also
wisdom to keep faithfully in mind what facts were discussed
and what agreements were reached. It is wisdom
to know the law thoroughly, to have clear perceptions
of what is actual law and what is merely called law,
being nothing but quibble and subterfuge. It is also
wisdom, if one has a request to make, to be able to determine
what he may ask for that will prove serviceable
and is proper for the other to grant; also, if one meets
a request, to know precisely what he may grant with
propriety and in what matters he must be careful not to
bind himself or those who come after him, such things,
namely, as may prove a disgrace to him rather than a
distinction. Finally, it is wisdom not to be strait-handed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>about things which one may just as well dispose of, lest
such stint or stinginess bring shame upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also great wisdom in moderation and righteousness.
All forms of learning, insight, and good foresight
which is necessary to courtesy and good breeding,
to stewardship, government and the enforcement of
law,—these, too, are akin to wisdom. And you will
need to learn all this thoroughly, if you wish to be known
among kings and chieftains as an estimable man, for all
who know these things are received with favor among
the great. Furthermore, the lives of men who have
mastered this knowledge may bring great honor to
themselves and profit to many others. But wisdom has
many forms, for it springs from roots which have many
branches. And from these roots of wisdom rises the
mightiest of all stems, which again divides into large
boughs, many branches, and a multitude of twigs of
different sizes, some small and some large. These are
later distributed among men in such a way that some
obtain the larger and some the smaller ones, and these
riches have their value according as they are loved. He
who is sure to appreciate this wealth and share it freely
receives a large amount; for the nature of this possession
is such that it is most attracted to him who loves it most
and uses it most liberally. And if men knew how to
value and appreciate these riches properly, gold and
silver would seem to them like rust, clay, or ashes,
when compared with these treasures. But he who wishes
to secure this wealth must begin in this way: he must
fear Almighty God and love Him above all things.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XLI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It was clearly well-advised to continue this inquiry,
for now I have gotten both useful and precise
information; and this speech will surely help every man
who is at least somewhat intelligent to more definite
ideas than he had before. Moreover, those who have
received only slender wands from the boughs of wisdom
are more numerous than those who have received large
branches, some getting but the tiniest twigs, and some
a mere leaf, while those who get nothing must indeed
be few. Therefore I wish to ask you to instruct me further
in the art of choosing and laying hold on those
branches which may prove useful to myself and others.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The virtues that I have just enumerated grow
especially on the boughs of wisdom, but they ramify
into a great many good branches and twigs. Now these
are the branches which are most useful: a rational outlook,
a temperate mind, and the capacity to determine
judiciously what one owes to every other man. If you
are angry with any man because of a law suit or some
evil deed, take careful thought before seeking revenge,
as to how important the matter really is and how great
a retribution it is worth. When you hear things in the
speech of other men which offend you much, be sure to
investigate with reasonable care whether the tales be
true or false; but if they prove to be true and it is proper
for you to seek revenge, take it with reason and moderation
and never when heated or irritated. Even though
you hear tidings which seem damaging to yourself or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>your business, such as loss of property or men, always
bear it with a calm and undaunted temper. Let the loss
of wealth seem least to you, for you must bear in mind
that it is sinful to worship wealth or to love it too highly,
even though it returns a man’s love and comes abundantly
into his keeping. And to love wealth much, when
it seems inclined to turn away from a man and does not
return his love, is surely sinful and will lead to grief.
Remember, too, that all come destitute into the world;
and our mode of departure from this life is such that
wealth cannot follow us out of the world. Nevertheless,
you must take heed that nothing is lost through your
neglect or indifference. And never grieve so deeply over
a loss that you cannot be hopeful and cheerful as before.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you suffer loss of men, bear that loss, too, with a
calm spirit; for remember that every man in departing
this life fulfils a law in human nature, inasmuch as no
one is created to live forever in this world. Let it grieve
you more, if an acquaintance of yours who has not
lived as he ought here on earth, should die in that state
and leave the world in disgrace; but most of all if you
fear that his soul is in peril; for such things are rather
to be lamented than that in dying he pays a debt to
nature. But if he lived uprightly while on earth and
made proper provision for his soul before he died, then
you may take comfort in the good repute that lives after
him, and even more in the blissful happiness which you
believe he will enjoy with God in the other world. In
the same way you must keep your spirit calm and in
good control when such events come to pass as may seem
profitable to you and stir your heart to joy and gladness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>whether it be the death of men whom you have hated,
or other happenings in which you might seem to find
pleasure. But if you should happen to hear of the death
of a man whom you counted an enemy and to whom
you had planned to do evil, if opportunity should be
found, rejoice much more in that God has saved you
from a threefold sin than in the death of him who has
departed. For you should be glad that God has prevented
your hands from committing the sinful deed
that was in your purpose, and has relieved your mind
of the long-continued wrath and bitterness which you
cherished against your enemy while he lived.</p>

<p class='c010'>Likewise, if high honors and dignities should come
to you from a king or from other magnates, it is important
that you should know how to receive them with
modesty, lest what befalls so many an indiscreet man
should also happen to you. For it is often the case that
when one who is lacking in good sense receives any
preferment from great men, he will rate himself so high
in his pride and avarice that he counts no other man
his equal. But such pretension leads to the downfall of
everyone who behaves in this way; inasmuch as it is
God’s purpose to strike down immoderate pride with
sacred humility; and everyone who is too proud and
greedy in his behavior will surely find God a constant
opponent. Now if you should be so fortunate as to receive
preferments from a king or other princes, remember
it is God’s method and purpose, by prompting them
(for He holds the minds and hearts of chiefs in His hand),
to elevate such men as He wishes to honor and dignity.
On the other hand, it is also the duty of every man to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>assist all those who have less strength than he. Keep in
mind, then, if God should raise you up to any place of
honor, that it must be to the profit of all who are less
capable than yourself, except such as hate morality and
right counsel; to them it should be a hindrance for a just
man to be given power and authority. If God gives you
wisdom and clear insight and you have also the good
fortune to be awarded honors by great men, there are
certain vices which you need especially to guard against:
arrogant self-esteem, avarice that yearns for bribes, and
forgetful neglect of the needs of men who are less capable
than yourself. Keep constantly before your eyes as a
warning the misfortunes of those who have fallen into
disgrace because of immoderate pride. Also keep in
mind, as a comforting hope, the careers of men who have
received constant honors because of their steadfast justice
and humility.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XLII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A DISCUSSION OF HOW GOD REWARDS RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br /> HUMILITY, AND FIDELITY, ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES<br /> DRAWN FROM SACRED AND PROFANE HISTORY</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I see clearly that God creates men unequal in
power and wisdom because He wishes to see how each
one is going to use what He has endowed him with,
whether in high living for the glorification of self, or in
bountiful kindness toward those who have need of him
and have not received such gifts from God. And now I
want to ask you to cite a few examples both of men
whose good sense and humility have brought them
honor and of such as have suffered destruction through
vain pride.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span><i>Father.</i> There have been so many cases of that sort,
that we should have to extend our talk to a great length,
if we were to mention all those of either class which we
know could serve as examples to show how these things
have worked out. I shall therefore name a few only,
though some of each kind, for in that way a long discourse
may be the sooner finished. The following instances
are ancient and easily remembered. When
Joseph was sold into Egypt,<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c015'><sup>[287]</sup></a> a mighty lord bought him;
but after he had purchased him he found that Joseph
was a discreet man, and he preferred and honored him
above all his other servants, not only above those whom
he kept in bondage, but even above his freeborn kinsmen;
and he gave into his hands the oversight of his
wealth and property, house and home, and all his welfare.
But because Joseph was a handsome man, kind
and courteous in behavior, and sensible in speech, he
won the love and friendship of all who knew him and
were subject to the same lord who was Joseph’s master.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wife of this mighty man loved Joseph more than
was proper, and impelled by evil desire, she sought to
commit a vile sin against her husband, because of the
love that she bore for Joseph; and she was not ashamed
in her bold passion to intimate to him what she had in
mind. But when he learned her purpose, he replied in
this wise: “We cannot deal with each other as equals,
for you are my lady and I am your thrall; and it would
be a very great disgrace for you to submit yourself to
me and too bold and rash in me to bring such dishonor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>upon you. But even worse is the unfaithfulness toward
my lord which I should be guilty of, if I were to reward
his kindness in this way like a treacherous thrall. For
he has trusted me, his servant, so far as to give all his
wealth and riches into my hands and keeping, and
I must not deceive my lawful master with shameful
treachery, unless I should wish to prove the saying in
daily use that it is ill to have a thrall as a chosen friend.”
But when the woman saw that Joseph was a good man
and wished to be faithful, she thought it a shame that
he should know her faithlessness, and, prompted by
enmity and not by justice, she became anxious to work
his ruin, if possible. So she told her husband that Joseph
had made an unseemly request and added that it showed
great audacity in a thrall to make such bold remarks
to his lady. She was believed as a good wife, and Joseph
was cast into prison strongly fettered and heavily
chained, the purpose being to let him end his days by
rotting alive because of his pride and faithlessness. But
when God, Who always loves justice and humility, saw
the faithfulness of Joseph whom He knew to be innocent,
He shaped the outcome so that Joseph profited
by the condemnation that he had suffered though innocent.
For God saved him from prison under such circumstances
that he was elevated to far greater prominence
than before; and God prompted King Pharaoh to make
Joseph master and judge of all Egypt next to the king
himself; and this office he held into his old age and as
long as he lived.</p>

<p class='c010'>Long after this and in another place, a somewhat
similar experience came to a famous king, who ruled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>over many realms. He was called by three names, because
the languages differed in the lands that he ruled
over: in one place he was called Artaxerxes; in another
place, Cyrus; and some tell us that to him God spoke
these kind words by the mouth of his prophet: “To
mine anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have
holden to subdue nations before him; and I will loose
the loins of kings,” etc.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c015'><sup>[288]</sup></a> Others, however, maintain
that it was another Cyrus who is referred to in this
scripture; but we shall not discuss this any longer, since
we cannot be sure whether it was written about this
Cyrus or another. But in a third place the king was
called Ahasuerus. And whereas he himself was mighty
and excellent, he also had a wealthy wife named Vashti,
who was his queen. Once when the king was absent in
distant warfare to extend his dominion, he had appointed
Queen Vashti to govern that part of his kingdom
where his court resided. On his return home with
a wealth of spoils, he made a great feast to gladden all
those among his lords who had accompanied him on
the campaign; and Queen Vashti made another feast
for her own lords, who had remained at home to assist
her in the government. Then the king commanded
Vashti to appear before him in his hall in all her regalia
and arrayed in all the beauty of queenly raiment and
thus to show her joy in his home-coming and do honor
to his feast. But Queen Vashti refused to obey the king’s
command, saying that she could not leave her own feast,
having invited many good chiefs. When the king saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>her arrogance and pride, he concluded that she esteemed
him no more highly for the perilous toil that he had
endured while extending his frontiers than she esteemed
herself for having remained quietly at home with the
regency, which he had left in her hands. Because of this
presumption the king became so wrathful, that he decreed
that Vashti had forfeited the office of queen and
all the authority which she possessed. And he found a
captive maiden of the people of Israel, whose name was
Esther, who was then in bondage in his kingdom, though
she had sprung from a prominent family in her native
land, and this maiden the king placed in Vashti’s seat,
endowing her with all the power that Vashti had once
possessed; and he made Esther queen of all his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few days later another event occurred at this same
court. There was a famous and powerful chief named
Haman and he was with King Ahasuerus. So highly did
the king esteem Haman that all the people were ordered
to obey him and bow down before him as before the
king himself. Now there was also a man named Mordecai,
a captive of the people of Israel, who was Queen
Esther’s uncle; but inasmuch as he was both poor and
in bondage, he dared not make known his kinship to
the queen; nor dared the queen show greater deference
to him than to any other in the royal service. Then it
happened one day, when Haman the prince came to see
the king, that on his return home his way passed near
where Mordecai sat. But Mordecai was brooding over
the bondage in which he had been placed along with
the people who had been taken captive out of Israel;
and being in deep thought he failed to notice that Haman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>was passing so near, and consequently did not
rise to bow before him. But when Haman saw that an
alien thrall neglected to bow the knee before him, he
became so wrathful that as soon as he came home he
ordered a high gallows to be raised near his house, on
which he intended to hang Mordecai. He also caused
letters to be sent throughout the realm permitting every
man to deal with the people of Israel as he liked: whoever
wished to do so might plunder them, or force them
into bondage and servitude, or even slay them.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the news of this came to Mordecai, necessity
compelled him to deal more boldly with the queen than
before: he came to wait upon her, and, throwing himself
at her feet, he told these tidings with much sorrow.
When the queen heard that the entire nation from which
she had sprung was condemned, she called upon God
with all her soul; next she sought the king’s presence,
robed in the stately apparel of a queen, and fell humbly
at his feet. But when the queen had entered and the
king saw that she came in such deep humility and
with troubled countenance, he perceived that she had
a matter of such great importance to bring before him
that she would have to find the courage in his favor to
state what concerned her. Taking her hand he raised
her up, spoke gently to her, seated her beside him, and
bade her state clearly all the details of her errand. Queen
Esther did as the king commanded and related the whole
event just as it had occurred; and then she begged him
to take action according to royal mercy rather than
according to Haman’s excessive anger. When the king
saw Haman’s boundless ambition and arrogant wrath,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>he caused Haman himself to be hanged upon the gallows
which he had intended for Mordecai, and sent
orders throughout the entire realm that the people of
Israel be allowed to live in complete freedom according
to the ordinances of their sacred laws; and he gave to
Mordecai all the authority that Haman had once possessed.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c015'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>From this you will observe that God demands moderation
and fairness, humility, justice, and fidelity as a
duty from those whom he raises to honor. For Joseph,
as we said before, was rewarded with splendid honors
and great advancement because of his faithfulness and
humility, although he had been sold for money like a
thrall into a strange land; but God soon raised him by
the king’s command to be a lord and the highest judge
in all Egypt next to the king himself. One may also observe
from this how much it is contrary to God’s will
to exalt oneself through vain conceit; for Queen Vashti
lost her queenship and all her power in a single day because
of her pride, while a captive maiden of a strange
people was appointed in her stead; and Haman lost all
his authority in a single day because of his excessive
vanity, while his dignities were given to a stranger, a
captive thrall. Now if you should win honors from great
lords, beware of an outcome like those in the stories
which you have just heard, and there are many such;
but make good use of the story that I told you earlier
about Joseph.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are still other examples which go far back into
the days of Emperor Constantine: for God had appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>him ruler of all the world, and he turned to
righteousness and Christianity as soon as he came to
understand the holy faith. He gave his mother, Queen
Helena, a kingdom east of the sea in the land of the
Jews. But because her realm and dominion were there,
she came to be persuaded that no faith concerning God
could be correct but that held by the Jews; and as letters
passed between them, the queen and her son the emperor,
they began to realize that they differed somewhat
in the beliefs which each of them held concerning God.
Then the emperor commanded the queen to come over
the sea from the east with her wise and learned men and
many other lords to a meeting in Rome, where the verities
of the holy faith should be examined. But when the
queen arrived with her company, the emperor had called
together many bishops including Pope Sylvester and
many wise men, both Christians and heathen. When the
conference had begun and a court had been appointed
to decide between the emperor and the queen, it became
evident to both that there was likely to be a violent dispute
between the Christian bishops and the learned
Jews and other wise men who had come with the queen
from the east, in view of the fact that each side would
produce weighty arguments from its books against the
other to prove and confirm its own learning and holy
faith. They saw clearly, therefore, that it would be
necessary for the assembly to appoint upright judges,
who could weigh in a tolerant and rational spirit all the
arguments that might be offered on either side.</p>

<p class='c010'>But whereas the emperor with the pope and the Christian
bishops was the defender of holy Christianity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the queen the protecting shield of the Jewish faith, it
was clear to both that it would be improper for them
to subject themselves to temptation by acting as judges
in this dispute. So they ordered a careful search to be
made among the wise men to find whether there might
be some in all their number who were so reliable in wisdom,
judgment, and rightmindedness, that all those
present could trust them to judge rightly in their contest.
But when the entire multitude had been examined,
only two men were found whom the people dared choose
to be judges in these important matters; and both of
these men were heathen and bound neither to the law
of the Christians nor to the Jewish faith. One of them
was named Craton: he was a great philosopher and
thoroughly versed in all learning; he was a friend of
mighty men and enjoyed their favor; but never had
he cared for more of this world’s riches than what he
needed for clothes and food. And when great men sometimes
gave him more than he required, he would give
away what he did not consume to such as were needy.
It was also in his nature to speak little but truthfully,
and no man knew that falsehood had ever been found
on his lips; wherefore all felt that the merits of wisdom
and good character which he possessed would surely
make him worthy to judge in these important matters.
The other who was chosen judge was named Zenophilus;
he was a famous and powerful prince, and where he
directed the government it was not known that he had
ever swerved from justice. He was a great master of
eloquence and learned in all science, friendly in speech
and affable, though a man of authority. Nor could anyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>recall that falsehood had ever been found on his
lips. These having been chosen to act as judges in behalf
of all present, the Christians and the Jews held a
court; and these two decided all the disputes, as they
were chosen to do, and it was found as before that in
no wise did they deviate from justice.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c015'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>I have cited these instances that you might appreciate
the humility and rightmindedness of both the
emperor and the queen; for though they were lords of
the entire world, they regarded it as proper to sit in
obedience to chosen judges who were much inferior to
themselves in both power and wealth and every other
respect. Likewise you are to appreciate what great honor
these men gained through their wisdom and uprightness;
for though they were both heathen, they were
superior to all others as to insight into the holy faith
and the world’s welfare. And now you will appreciate
what I told you earlier in our conversation, namely,
that much depends on the example that a man leaves
after him. Joseph lived before the birth of our Lord
Jesus Christ; he was sold for money into Egypt as an
alien thrall; but his faithfulness and humility pleased
God so highly that he was made ruler next to the king
of all those who were native to the land and had wealth
and kinsmen there, whether they were rich or poor. It
is many hundred winters since Joseph died, but his
glory still lives and is daily recalled among all thoughtful
people throughout the world. Queen Vashti died
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>long before the birth of Christ, as did Haman the prince;
but the disgrace that came upon them because of their
pride and folly still lives. Queen Esther bears even to
this day the living honor which she gained through her
humility; though she was brought to India<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c015'><sup>[291]</sup></a> as a captive
bondmaiden, she was later made queen over many
large kingdoms and seated upon the throne from which
Queen Vashti was banished.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although the events that we last related in speaking
of Emperor Constantine and his mother Queen Helena
happened after the birth of Christ, it was still so long
ago that no man can recall them because of their antiquity;
yet they are bright with honor even to this day.
Craton and Zenophilus, though they are dead, are celebrated
for their wisdom and righteousness. Though both
were heathen men, they were chosen to be judges over
nearly all the people who were in the world, and were
even trusted in behalf of all men, both Christians and
Jews, to pass judgment on those laws which neither of
them kept, but upon which the welfare of the world
nevertheless depended. From such occurrences you will
realize that God holds in His hand the tiller with which
He turns and moves the hearts of great lords whenever
He wishes, and controls all their thoughts according to
His will. For King Pharaoh raised up Joseph to a dominion
above that of all the other princes who were in
the kingdom before him. Ahasuerus deprived Vashti of
her queenship, though she was both wealthy and high-born,
and appointed Esther queen in her stead. He also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>hanged Haman, the renowned prince, and gave all his
power to Mordecai, who was once a bondman brought
captive from a strange land. Emperor Constantine
placed Craton and Zenophilus, two heathen men, in the
judgment seat and trusted them to pass judgment on
the verities and the interpretation of the holy faith.
Now you shall know of a truth that all these events
have come to pass through God’s providence and secret
commands; and all these things are noted down for the
memory of men in the future, so that all may learn and
derive profit from the good examples, but shun the evil
ones. And if it should be your fortune to become a kingsman,
remember these examples that I have now shown
you (and there are a great many others like them which
we have not mentioned in this speech); and be sure to
follow all those which you see are likely to profit you.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XLIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE DUTIES AND THE EXALTED POSITION OF THE KING</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> God reward you, sire, for taking so much time
to hear all my questions and for giving such very patient
and useful answers: for these talks will surely lead me
to think and observe more accurately than I did before.
It may also be that others will study these learned discourses
in the future and derive knowledge, good insight,
and profitable manners from them. There are,
however, several other things which I have in mind to
investigate and wish very much to ask about. And therefore
I beg you not yet to grow weary of teaching me;
for your permission gives me courage to confide so fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>in you that I am not likely to overlook anything that
my mind is eager to know. Indeed, it seems to me that
this subject opens up such a wide field, that there must
be many things left which one needs to know and discern
fully, if one wishes to be rated a worthy man by
kings or other great lords; and I am eager to hear you
talk further about these matters.</p>

<p class='c010'>But for this once I wish to inquire about men of
greater importance than those who have to serve the
mighty. I see clearly that those who serve are in duty
bound to strive after the best manners, knowledge, wisdom,
and righteousness; but it would seem that those,
who are chiefs and rulers and whom all others must
serve, owe an even greater duty to seek both knowledge
and insight; above all it must be their duty to love
every form of righteousness, since they have authority
to punish all others who are not righteous. Therefore I
wish to ask with your permission what customs the king
himself should observe which would accord with his
regal dignity. Tell me clearly so that I can understand
what business or conduct is demanded of him early in
the morning and what affairs he is later occupied with
throughout the day; for he is so highly honored and
exalted upon earth that all must bend and bow before
him as before God. So great is his power that he may
dispose as he likes of the lives of all who live in his kingdom:
he lets him live whom he wills and causes him to
be slain whom he wills. But I have observed this, that
if a man becomes another’s banesman, all upright men
from that time on have an aversion for him as for a
heathen; since to slay a man is counted a great sin for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>which the one who commits it must suffer great penance
and much trouble before Christian people will again admit
him to fellowship. And again, you told me in an
earlier speech to shun manslaughter; but you added
that all manslaughter committed by royal command or
in battle I need shun no more than any other deed which
is counted good. Now if the king has received such great
authority from God that all slaughter done by his command
is without guilt, I should imagine that he must
need to be very wise, cautious, and upright in all his
doings; and therefore I wish to have you explain fully
the things that I have now asked about, unless you feel
that my questions are stupid, or that I am presuming
too much in showing curiosity about the doings of such
great men.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Your questions are not stupid, for we may
just as well talk about how the king has to order his
government or his conduct as about other men. It surely
is his bounden duty to seek knowledge and understanding,
and he ought indeed to be well informed as to what
has occurred in the past, for in that way he will gain
insight for all the business that pertains to his kingship.
You have stated that he is highly honored and exalted
on earth and that all bow before him as before God;
and the reason for this is that the king represents divine
lordship: for he bears God’s own name and sits upon
the highest judgment seat upon earth, wherefore it
should be regarded as giving honor to God Himself,
when one honors the king, because of the name which
he has from God. The son of God himself, when he was
on earth, taught by his own example that all should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>honor the king and show him due obedience; for he
commanded his apostle Peter to draw fishes up from
the depth of the sea and to open the mouth of the fish
that he caught first, and said that he would find a penny
there, which he ordered him to pay to Caesar as tribute
money for them both. From this you are to conclude
that it is the duty of every one upon earth to respect and
honor the royal title which an earthly man holds from
God; for the very son of God thought it proper to honor
the royal dignity so highly that he, to the glory of kingship,
made himself subject to tribute along with that
one of his disciples whom he made chief of all his apostles
and gave all priestly honors.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c006' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XLIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> There remains one thing, which, as usual, I
shall need to have explained further, as it is not very
clear to me. You stated, and it seems reasonable, that
the king holds a title of high honor and dignity from
God Himself; but I do not see clearly why God made
Himself subject to the tribute of an earthly king; since
He must, it seems to me, be above all kings, seeing that
He rules the earthly as well as the heavenly kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> That God Himself has honored earthly kings
you will observe from the fact that, when He came down
to earth from the loftiest pinnacles of heaven, He regarded
Himself as having come among men as a guest
and did not wish to claim a share in the earthly kingship,
though he might have done so. But He fulfilled the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>words that David had spoken: “The Lord ruleth in the
heavens, but verily he hath given an earthly kingdom
to the sons of men.”<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c015'><sup>[292]</sup></a> Now God, while He was on earth,
wished to honor earthly kings and kingdoms rather
than disparage them in any way; for He would not
deprive the earthly kingship of what He had formerly
given into the control of earthly lords; but God showed
a perfect obedience to Caesar. You should also observe
that, just as God commanded His apostle Peter to examine
the first fish that he drew and take a penny from
its mouth (and God did not want him to examine the
second fish or the third, but the first only), similarly
every man should in all things first honor the king and
the royal dignity. For God Himself calls the king His
anointed, and every king who possesses the full honors
of royalty is rightly called the Lord’s anointed. In like
manner one of God’s apostles said in a sermon while
instructing the people in the true faith: “Fear God and
honor your king,”<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c015'><sup>[293]</sup></a>—which is almost as if he had
literally said that he who does not show perfect honor
to the king does not fear God.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every king, as you have said, ought, indeed, to be
wise, well-informed, and above everything upright, that
he may be able to realize fully that he is after all merely
a servant of God, though he is honored and exalted so
highly in the supreme service of God, that all bow down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>before him as before God; for in so doing they worship
God and the holy name which the king bears but not
the king himself. It is, therefore, in the very nature
of kingship to inspire all with a great awe and fear of
the king, wherefore every one trembles who hears him
named. But he ought also to appear gracious and
friendly toward all good men, lest any one should fear
him so much as to be deterred from presenting any important
request to him because of his severity.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the night, as soon as the king is sated with sleep,
it should be his duty and business to center his thoughts
upon the kingdom as a whole and to consider how his
plans may be formed and carried out in such a way that
God will be well pleased with the care that he gives to
the realm; also how it may be made most profitable and
obedient to himself; further what measure of firmness
he must use in restraining the rich lest they become too
arrogant toward the poor, and what caution in uplifting
the poor, lest they grow too defiant toward the wealthy;
wherefore he needs to ponder and plan judiciously how
to hold everyone to moderation in the estate in which
he is placed. This, too, the king must be sure to keep
in his thoughts, that when it becomes necessary to
chastise those who are not satisfied with what God has
planned for them, he must not be so lenient in his punishment,
that this excessive indulgence should lead anyone
to consider it safe to transgress what ought to stand
as rightfully ordained. Nor must he be so severe in his
penalties that God and rightminded men will regard
him as punishing more from a cruel disposition than
from a sense of justice. These things and many more a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>king ought to reflect upon at night when he is done with
sleep, for then fewer matters will come upon him unawares
during the day, when the needs of the land are
presented to him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XLV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>CONCERNING THE MODERATION WHICH A KING MUST OBSERVE<br /> IN HIS JUDICIAL SENTENCES AND PENALTIES,<br /> WITH ILLUSTRATIONS DRAWN FROM THE STORY OF<br /> GOD’S JUDGMENT IN THE CASE OF ADAM AND<br /> EVE, IN WHICH CASE TRUTH AND JUSTICE<br /> WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PEACE AND MERCY</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It is evident that a king must possess great
constraint and an even greater sense of justice, as you
remarked earlier, if he is to find the true mean in meting
out punishment so as to be neither too lenient nor too
severe. And now I wish to ask whether there are any
examples which may guide him toward this moderation,
inasmuch as you have stated that every king should
have knowledge of all the examples that are to be found.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I repeat what I said then that no man needs
to be more learned or better informed in all subjects
than a king, for both he and his subjects have great
need of this. But one who has a thorough knowledge of
past events will meet but few contingencies that are
really unexampled. Now the following examples are very
ancient, and every king should keep them frequently
before his eyes and seek guidance from them for the
government of his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>When God had created the entire world and had
beautified it with grass and other herbage, as well as
with birds and beasts, He appointed two human beings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>a man and a woman, to have dominion over everything.
He led the two, Adam and Eve, to the highest point of
Paradise and showed them all the birds and beasts and
all the flowers and glories of Paradise. Then God said
to Adam and Eve: “All these things that you now see
I give to you for your maintenance and dominion, if
you will keep the covenant which I now establish between
ourselves. But these are the laws which you must
carefully observe, if you wish to keep the gifts which I
have now given you: that beautiful tree which you see
standing with lovely apples in the midst of Paradise is
called the tree of knowledge, and the fruit which the
tree bears is called the apples of knowledge. This tree
you must not touch nor may you eat of the apples which
it bears, for as soon as you eat of them you shall die;
but of everything else that you now see you may freely
eat according to desire.” Four sisters were called to witness
this covenant, divine virgins, who should hear the
laws decreed and learn all the terms of the agreement:
the first was named Truth, the second, Peace, the third,
Justice, and the fourth, Mercy. And God spoke thus to
these virgins: “I command you to see to it that Adam
does not break this covenant which has been made between
Me and him: follow him carefully and protect
him as long as he observes these things that are now
decreed; but if he transgresses, you shall sit in judgment
with your Father, for you are the daughters of
the very Judge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When the speech was ended, God vanished from
Adam’s sight; and Adam went forth to view the glories
of Paradise. But at that time the serpent, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>more subtle and crafty than any other beast, came in
the guise of a maiden<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c015'><sup>[294]</sup></a> to Eve, Adam’s wife, and addressed
her in great friendliness: “Blessed is your husband
and you with him, since God has given all things
into your power; for it is now the duty of every beast to
obey your commands, seeing that Adam is our lord and
you are our lady. But now I want to ask you whether
God has withheld anything upon earth from your dominion,
or whether you may enjoy all things as you
wish without hesitation.” Eve replied: “God has given
us dominion over all things that he has created upon
earth except the tree that stands in the midst of Paradise;
of this He has forbidden us to eat, having said that
we shall die, if we eat thereof.” The serpent said to Eve:
“Oho, my lady! He does not wish you to become so
wise that you know both good and evil; for He knows
the difference between good and evil things, while you
know good things only. But when you have eaten of the
apples of knowledge, you will become like God and will
have knowledge of evil things as well as of good.” As
soon as the serpent had disappeared from Eve’s sight,
she called Adam her husband and told him all this
speech. Then she took two of the apples of knowledge,
ate one herself, and gave the other to Adam. But when
they had eaten these apples, their knowledge was extended
to evil things, as the serpent had said; and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>began to observe the shapes of beasts and birds and
trees, and finally how they themselves were formed.
Then said Adam: “We are shamefully naked, we two,
for there is nothing to hide our limbs; beasts are covered
with hair and tail, birds with feathers, and trees with
branches and leaves; we two alone have shamefully
naked limbs.” Thereupon they took broad leaves from
the trees and covered those of their members which they
were most ashamed to have naked. Then Peace came
forth and spoke to Adam and Eve: “Now you have
broken the law and your covenant with God, and I will
no longer give you the security in the open fields that
you have thus far enjoyed; but I will keep you safe in
a secret hiding place until judgment is pronounced in
your case; and I give you this safety that you may have
opportunity to present your defense. But you must take
good care to make a plea which may profit you, and
prove a defense rather than a detriment.” Truth came
forth and spoke to Adam: “Take heed, when you come
to plead your case, that you do not lie, for then I shall
testify with you; tell everything just as it happened,
for if you lie about anything, I shall testify against you
at once.” Justice came forth and said: “It is my duty
and office to make sure that you are not unjustly condemned;
but the more you are found guilty of lies and
wrongdoing, the more shall I oppose you.” Mercy came
forth and said to Adam: “I shall add assistance and
mercy to your plea, if you heed carefully all that my
sisters have taught.” But fear had come upon Adam
and he went away to hide among the trees, lest he should
be seen naked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>At midday God went forth to view the beauties of
Paradise and Adam’s stewardship; but as He did not
see Adam in the wide fields, He called him, asking where
he was. Adam replied: “I hid myself, Lord, because I
was ashamed to show myself naked before Thy face.”
God answered, saying: “Why shouldst thou be more
ashamed of thy nakedness now than at our former meeting,
unless it be that thou hast broken the law and hast
eaten of the apples of knowledge, which I forbade thee
to eat.” Adam replied as if defending himself: “The
woman that Thou gavest me led me into this fault; if
I had been alone about my affairs and if Thou hadst
not given me this wife to advise with me, I should have
kept the appointed law and should not have transgressed
Thy command.” Then God said to Eve: “Why
didst thou give thy husband this evil counsel to break
the law?” Eve replied as if defending her case: “The
crafty serpent gave me that evil advice; had he not been
created or appeared before me, I should not have come
upon this evil design.” Then God said: “Since the law
has now been broken, I want those virgins whom I appointed
keepers of our covenant to sit in judgment with
us.” Then Truth spoke: “It is my duty and business to
show Adam’s guilt, inasmuch as he has concealed with
a lie what most of all led him to transgress. For this was
the chief motive in your case, that the apples were fair
and pleasant and sweet to taste, and that you desired
greatly to be wiser than was promised you. You committed
a theft in planning to take them secretly, covetous
robbery in taking them without permission, and
an act of insolent pride in wishing to become like unto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>God in wisdom beyond what was promised you.” Then
God said to Peace that she should give a brief opinion
in the case. Peace answered in this wise: “Whereas
Thou didst appoint me to watch over Adam’s safety
as long as there was no transgression, I now offer to
bring him an even greater insecurity, because he did
not know how to keep the great freedom which he enjoyed
before.” Then God said to Justice that she should
give judgment; and she answered in this wise: “Since
Adam was unable to keep the freedom that Peace had
secured for him, let him now suffer misery and distress
instead; and because he coveted knowledge of evil
things, let him experience evil in place of good; and
because he wished to make himself like God in knowledge
beyond what was permitted, and blamed God for
his transgression with lying excuses, let him suffer the
death of which he was warned before he transgressed.”
Then God said to Mercy that she should pass judgment
on this transgression. Mercy replied in these words:
“As it is my nature to urge forbearance and clemency
to some degree in every case, I request that Adam be
not destroyed through a merciless death; but since he
now must repent of his error as long as he lives, let him
have hope of mercy and help in his death, as long as he
does not despair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then it was discussed whether, in case he had sons,
they should suffer for his sin, or be allowed to enjoy the
gifts and the riches that God had given him at the beginning,
but from which he had been ousted like an
outlaw. Justice said: “How can his sons, who will be
begotten in exile, enjoy those gifts that he forfeited as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>an outlaw because of transgression? Let his sons follow
him to the death. But whereas he shall have hope of
mercy and leniency and of a return to the possessions
which he has now forfeited, let his sons be recalled with
him through a new covenant.” And when sentence had
been passed in Adam’s case, the sisters all came to a
friendly agreement; Mercy and Truth embraced while
Justice and Peace kissed each other with loving gestures.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c015'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Now every king ought to have these two things frequently
in mind: how God appeased His anger toward
the man and the woman for breaking the law, and what
judges He called in, lest His punishment should be too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>severe and merciless. Moreover, a king does justice to
all men when he does justice to any man or woman; but
all decisions which imply punishment he must always
consider in the presence of these four sisters; and it must
be such as will bring them into agreement, so that they
can kiss and embrace each other, in which case the
judgment will be neither too lenient nor too severe. A
king ought to consider very carefully how to bring the
minds of the sisters into agreement; for in all trials
they are arranged and seated apart in groups; Truth
and Justice on one side of the court and Mercy and
Peace on the other. They should be agreed and unanimous
in every case; but it frequently occurs that Peace
and Mercy give the whole suit over to Truth and Justice,
though all unite in the verdict none the less. Sometimes
it happens that each of the sisters has a full voice
in the decision according to right reckoning; but at
other times it may be that the larger share falls to Peace
and Mercy; but the sisters are unanimous in the verdict
none the less. It has also happened at times that, after
a verdict has been reached and confirmed, Mercy and
Peace have exercised leniency because of the prayers
and repentance of him who was in need of it.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XLVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN EXAMPLE OF RIGHTEOUS SEVERITY IN JUDGMENT<br /> DRAWN FROM THE STORY OF GOD’S<br /> CONDEMNATION OF LUCIFER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It looks to me now as if this is a more intricate
matter than I thought earlier; for it must require great
understanding and insight to harmonize the opinions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>of these sisters so that they will always be unanimous,
seeing that the verdict sometimes leans more to one
side than to the other. For you remarked that at times
the whole verdict falls to Truth and Justice and no
leniency is shown, while at other times the larger share
may fall to Peace and Mercy; and you also stated that
sometimes a sentence has been modified after it was
agreed to and confirmed. Now you have stated that
one can find examples of most things, if one looks for
them; and if there are any instances of such proceedings,
I should like to hear about them, so that the
subject may look clearer to me and also to others who
may hear about it. And it must surely be the highest
duty of kings to be well informed on such things, as on
all other subjects, since they will need them very frequently.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The world is now so ancient that, no matter
what comes to pass, one is likely to find that similar
events have occurred before; and nothing is likely to
happen of which a learned man can find no examples.
But of the fact that the entire judgment may fall to
Truth and Justice, no mercy being shown, there are
cases which occurred so early that I know of none before
them. When Lucifer, an angel in heaven, turned
traitor and committed a base crime against his Lord,
Truth and Justice condemned him to swift downfall
without hope of pardon. Into this condemnation all
his comrades and counsellors fell with him. And these
were the crimes which God punished with a merciless
doom.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XLVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF VERDICTS AND PENALTIES<br /> WITH ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE STORY OF<br /> LUCIFER’S REBELLION AND DOWNFALL<br /> AND OF THE SIN AND PUNISHMENT<br /> OF THE FIRST MAN AND WOMAN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I must ask you not to take offence if the questions
which I wish to bring up should seem childish and
ill advised; but since I do not fully understand the subject
that I intend to ask about next, it may also be that
there are others who do not understand it any better
than I. And it is that matter about the serpent, which,
you said, came to Eve, and speaking to her like a man
egged her on to transgress the law. Now I wish to ask
whether the serpent, unlike other beasts, was created
with power of speech; or whether other animals could
speak in those days, though now they are all dumb; and
for what reason the serpent wished to lead the woman
into transgression.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> We have had a very lengthy speech before us,
and if we were to comment on the whole, it would lengthen
very much a discussion that is already long; but certain
it is, we have spoken very few words which would not
be in need of comment, if a well informed man, who
thoroughly understands all these speeches, should come
to the task. But I believe it is more advisable for us to
continue as we have been doing since we began our conversation,
and leave the task of glossing our remarks to
others who may hear them later and are willing to do
the work with faithful care. Still, inasmuch as every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>question looks toward some reply or solution, it is
proper that I should enlarge somewhat on this speech,
so as to make the subject a little clearer to you and to
others who do not understand it better than you do. I
shall, however, run over it in a few words only, for I do
not care much to comment on my own remarks.</p>

<p class='c010'>You have asked whether serpents and other beasts
were created with the power of speech in the days when
Adam was appointed keeper of Paradise, and you shall
know of a truth that the gift of speech was not given to
any bodily creature but man. And since you wish to
know why speech was given to the serpent and why it
wished to lead the woman into transgression, I shall
now proceed to explain. The explanation begins with
the fact that God created angels before men. The angels
were immortal spirits, free from all corporal weakness,
and endowed with great beauty. But though created
with perfect beauty, they were held subject to this law,
that they must show love and obedience toward their
Creator in humility and without deceit. It was promised
them that they should keep their beauty and all the
other honors that God had given them, as long as they
kept this law; at the same time God gave them full
freedom to violate the law, if they wished; for He spoke
to them in this wise: “Since you were all created at the
same moment and none was begotten by another, each
one of you shall decide for himself and none for another
whether these laws that I have now ordained shall be
kept or broken. And if there are those who transgress
them, they shall be driven out of this life of bliss; while
those who observe the laws shall continue to enjoy unceasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>happiness and unending life in my noble service.
And I give you all a free choice to keep these laws or to
break them as you may prefer, in order that those who
observe them may be set apart as my chosen jewels,
while those who violate them shall suffer hatred and be
driven into cruel thralldom and wretched service.”</p>

<p class='c010'>These angels were all fair, but one was more handsome
than all the rest, wherefore he was called Lucifer; he
was appointed chief of many angels and a great multitude
made obeisance to him in service and friendship.
But God having finished His speech, Lucifer turned away
from God with all his following as if toward the north
and spoke thus: “Why should we suffer threats from
God in return for our service, seeing that we have power,
beauty and numbers in full measure to maintain our
prestige? Now I intend, like God, to set up a high-seat
in the northern part of heaven<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c015'><sup>[296]</sup></a> and to extend a wise
control over half of heaven or even more.” Then God
answered and said to Lucifer: “Since thou hast broken
the law by treacherous rebellion, thou canst no longer
have habitation with us; and whereas thou wouldst enjoy
dominion, depart to the kingdom that is prepared
for thee, where thou shalt have suffering instead of freedom,
misery instead of bliss, sorrows of every kind but
no joy. Let all those go with thee who did not oppose
thy design.” And as God looked upon them in His wrath,
all the heavens trembled before His countenance; and
His enemies fled with a terrible downfall, and they suffered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>a horrible change of countenance in the loss of
their beauty. Thereupon they sought out the places that
were assigned to them and were scattered about in all
the caves of hell, each appointed to a separate service.
In this way darkness was separated from light.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when God had made man and had given him a
blissful life in Paradise, Lucifer said to his companions:
“It is evidently God’s intention to give this one the
dominion from which He drove me out, unless he shall
act counter to God’s will. Even if God should appoint
other angels in our stead, we could never allow it, if we
could do anything to prevent it; but our disgrace would
be too great, if a man formed of clay or the filthy dust
of the earth were to enter into the eternal happiness
from which we were expelled. Therefore we must fight
incessantly against everyone who has such ambitions
and revenge our injuries with fierce hatred upon all
those whom we can overcome. Now I shall try to gain
a victory over the first man that God has created, so
that my companions may be able to overcome those
who come later.” Then he armed himself with seven
wiles from which he expected great aid: the first was
venomous envy; the second, burning hatred; the third,
false cunning; the fourth, specious deception; the fifth,
haughty arrogance; the sixth, covetous self-seeking; the
seventh, lustful desire. Then he said to himself: “Inasmuch
as I am now an invisible spirit, I cannot visibly
come to have speech with physical man, unless I adorn
my ugly countenance with a certain corporeal beauty.
I shall therefore enter this serpent which God has created
with the face of a maiden and which most resembles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>man in beauty; and I shall speak with his tongue to
Eve, Adam’s wife, and learn from her whether they are
created to full freedom without obedience to law, or
whether God has given them laws to keep, through
which I may be able to ruin their covenant with Him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thereupon this envious spirit sought the serpent that
is now called the asp, which in those days walked with
upright form on two feet like man and had a face like
a maiden’s, as we have just said. And when the evil
minded spirit came to Eve concealed in the body of this
serpent, he made use of the artifice that is called specious
deception, for he spoke to Eve with seductive sweetness
using these words: “Blessed is thy husband and thou
likewise.” This praise he did not give them out of good
will; rather did he praise their happiness in order to
drag them into misery through hatred and envy, and
he used false cunning when he asked Eve to tell him
whether God had given everything to Adam to control
and to enjoy without restriction. But when Eve in return
for his sweet words had given the desired information,
and he heard that death was to be their part if
they transgressed, he was glad, and then made use of
haughty arrogance in suggesting to Eve that they could
become like God in knowledge in this respect, that they
might be able to know good from evil. But he used lustful
desire when he bade her try how sweet and fragrant
was the apple of knowledge which was forbidden her.
And he employed covetous self-seeking when he caused
Eve to take for her own what God had earlier forbidden
her; for God had given everything into the power of
Adam and Eve, except this tree; but they longed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>have this even without permission, though everything
else was in their power. They knew this one difference
between good and evil, that good was better than evil;
wherefore they feared the death that was assured them.
But having never tasted the bitterness of evil, they
could not know what great misery they would suffer
for transgression; but they thought it would be a great
distinction to be like God in knowledge, and to know
the difference between good and evil things. But when
the serpent urged Eve to eat of the apples of knowledge,
she began to fear death, and replied thus to the serpent:
“I fear that, if I eat, I shall die, for such is God’s
threat. Now do you eat first while I look, and if you do
not die, I will eat, for if this fruit really does possess
death dealing powers, it will surely prove baneful to
other living beings besides me.” Then the spirit that
was concealed in the serpent said to himself: “I may
indeed eat the apple, for it will make me no more guilty
or mortal, inasmuch as I am already in the full wrath
of God.” But these words the woman did not hear.
Then Eve took an apple and placed it in the serpent’s
mouth and he ate forthwith. And when she saw that
it did him no harm, she immediately picked another
apple and ate; and she found it very sweet, just as the
serpent had told her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thereupon the serpent vanished from Eve’s sight;
but she called Adam her husband and told him these
things. But because he, too, feared the death that God
had threatened, he would not eat, unless he should see
Eve eat first. So Eve took two more apples and boldly
ate the one forthwith, for she had already tasted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>sweetness of the fruit, and instead of feeling shame for
what she had already done, she longed to taste it oftener.
When Adam saw that it did her no harm (and he even
observed a pleasurable sweetness upon her lips), he
took the apple that she had offered him and ate just
as she had done. But when they had eaten the apple,
their eyes were opened to a greater knowledge than
they had had before, just as the serpent had predicted:
for immediately they were ashamed of their naked
limbs, since they saw that the bodies of the birds were
covered with feathers and those of the beasts with hair,
while their own bodies were naked, and they were much
ashamed of that. But most of all did it shame them to
know that their transgression had made them guilty
before God; and they bore their bodies in fear and were
ashamed of their naked limbs. Soon they went to hide
among the trees, thus giving proof of their shortsightedness,
for they did not realize that God had such knowledge
of His handiwork and all the things that He had
made, that neither bushes nor forests could hide them
from His sight, since even the secret hiding places in the
caverns of hell lie bare and visible before His eyes at
all times.</p>

<p class='c010'>But while Adam was in hiding, God spoke to the
spirit that was concealed in the serpent: “Through
pride and evil intent thou didst raise the first rebellion,
there being none to ensnare thee, only thine own pride
and envy; wherefore Mine anger rages against thee
without mercy, and thou has forfeited eternal happiness
and all hope of returning to it. Thou hast now a
second time stirred My heart to anger because of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>sin that has just been committed. Adam will have to
suffer punishment for his transgression, but he shall
still have hope of return and mercy, because he came
into My wrath on account of thy wickedness and seductive
guile. And as thou overcamest Adam’s wife
while she was yet a virgin, so shall one of her daughters,
also a virgin, win a triumph over thee. And just as thou
seemest now to have led Adam with all his possessions
and kinship as spoils into thy dominion, so shall one of
his sons search all thy garners and carry all thy treasures
away as spoils; and leading forth Adam and all his faithful
kinsmen out of thy power in a glorious triumph, he
shall appoint him to an honored place among his sons
in the kingdom which thou wert fittingly deprived of.
And as a green tree bore the fruit through which thou
hast now won thy victory, so shall a dry tree bear the
fruit through which thy victory shall be brought to
naught.” Then God spoke to the serpent in which the
spirit had concealed himself: “Cursed art thou before
all the beasts upon earth; because thou hast received
Mine enemy and concealed him from the eyes of Eve
to the end that, hidden in thee, he might win a victory
over mankind. Therefore shalt thou lose the likeness to
a maiden’s face which thy countenance has borne and
shalt henceforth bear a grim and ugly face hateful to
mankind; thou shalt lose the feet that bore thy body
upright and henceforth crawl upon breast and belly.
Bitter and unclean dust shall be thy food, because thou
atest of the apple which thou tookest from the hand of
Eve. Thou shalt be a self-chosen vessel of venom and
death as evidence that thou didst hide venomous envy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>in thy body. I declare the covenant sundered between
thee and all mankind; thy head and neck shall be
crushed under the heel and the tread of men in revenge
for the treachery which mankind has suffered through
thy slippery cunning. And since thou didst cause man
to break the law with his mouth and in eating, the
spittle that comes forth from the mouth of a fasting
man shall prove as dangerous a venom to thy life, if
thou taste it, as thy venom is to man, if he taste it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then God, calling Adam and Eve, asked where they
were. And Adam replied: “We hid ourselves, Lord, being
ashamed to appear naked before Thy face.” In the
first word that Adam answered God, he lied to Him;
for they knew themselves guilty of violating the law
and hid for that reason; but Adam concealed this in the
answer that he gave to God. Then God said to him:
“Why should you be more ashamed of your nakedness
now than when we last talked together, unless it be that
you have increased in knowledge from eating the apples
that I forbade you?” But when Adam saw that he
could not conceal how they had broken the law, he
sought to escape by placing the blame for the act on
another rather than on himself, for he answered in these
words: “If I had been alone about my affairs and if
Thou hadst not given me this woman to advise with
me, I should have kept the appointed law and would
not have broken Thy commands.” These words added
greatly to Adam’s guilt in God’s eyes, for he sought defense
rather than mercy. But if he had spoken in this
wise: “Remember now, O Lord, that I am formed of
fragile stuff like a pot of brittle clay, and am in greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>need of Thy forbearance and mercy than the merits of
my case can demand, for in my weakness I have fallen
into great guilt against Thee, O Lord, because of my
transgression,”—then his guilt would at once have
been lessened in the sight of God, inasmuch as he would
be seeking mercy but not defense. But when God heard
Adam replying as if excusing himself, He said as if in
wrath: “Thou shalt put no blame upon Me for creating
the woman; for I gave her to thee to be a delight and
a companion, not that thou shouldst commit law-breaking
by her counsel. I even warned thee not to transgress
and told thee what guilt threatened if thou didst break
the law. Why then didst thou follow thy wife’s miserable
advice rather than My saving counsel, if thou didst not
do it through pride and avarice, wishing to equal Me
in knowledge and therefore eager to know what was
not promised thee?”</p>

<p class='c010'>After that God spoke to Eve: “Why didst thou egg
thy husband on to transgress?” And Eve was anxious
that another should bear the blame for her guilt rather
than herself, for she spoke in this wise: “This crafty serpent
gave me that evil advice; had he not been created
or appeared before me, I should not have transgressed
or egged on my husband to transgress.” When God
heard Eve’s excuse, He spoke in His wrath: “It looks
to Me as if you both wish to blame Me for your law-breaking:
Adam blamed Me for having created thee to
advise with him, and now thou findest fault with Me
for having created the serpent. I created the serpent as
I created all the other beasts of the earth, but I did not
give him to you as a counsellor; on the contrary, I made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>him subject to your dominion like all the other beasts
of the earth. I warned you both to commit no sin and
told you to look for death, if you did. Now your deed
appears no better in your defense than before in the
transgression; wherefore you shall suffer the death with
which I threatened you. Though you may not immediately
fall down dead, you shall, nevertheless, in your
death suffer a long punishment for your offence, and all
your offspring shall be responsible with you for this
transgression. And the while that you live upon earth
you shall suffer sorrowful distress instead of enjoying
the blissful freedom which you knew not how to keep.
And whereas thou didst transgress before Adam, I will
increase thy troubles beyond what you are both to suffer:
thou shalt be subject to the control of thy husband
and to all his commands, and shalt therefore seem of
lesser importance and lower in the sight of thy sons.
The children that thou shalt conceive in lustful passion
thou shalt bring forth in pain and imminent peril; it
shall also be thy duty to give thy children all forms of
service in toil and troublesome care while bringing them
up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then God said: “Adam has now become as wise as
any one of us, knowing good and evil. Have care that he
does not eat from the tree of life without permission,
as he did of the apples of knowledge, lest he live eternally
in his guilt.” Thereupon God appointed Cherubim
to guard the path leading to the tree of life with a flaming
sword which constantly turned its fiery edge in
every direction so that none could pass forward without
permission. Then God said to Adam: “Because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>thou didst hearken to thy wife’s evil advice rather than
to my good counsel and hast eaten of the forbidden
fruit, the earth, which gave thee all manner of desirable
fruit in her motherly kindness, shall be cursed through
thy deed. As if in sorrowful wrath, she shall refuse thee
such herbs as thou mayest think suitable for food:
thistles and weeds shall she give thee for herbs, unless
thou till her soil with labor and drench it with thy sweat;
for henceforth thou shalt gain thy food upon earth with
toil.” Thereafter God gave Adam and Eve coats of skin
and said to them: “Since you are ashamed of your
naked limbs, cover yourselves now with the garments
of travail and sorrow and fare forth into the wide fields
to find your food with irksome toil. And finally you
shall rest in the deathlike embraces of earth and be
changed again naturally into the mortal materials from
which you were made in the beginning.” Then said
Adam: “For justice and mercy I thank Thee, O Lord,
for I see clearly how greatly I have sinned; likewise do
I own Thy grace in that I am not to suffer merciless
destruction like Lucifer. Sorrowing shall I descend into
the deathlike shadows of hell; yet I shall ever rejoice
in the hope of returning; for in this I trust to Thee, O
Lord, that Thou wilt show me the light of life even in
the darkness of death. And I shall ever look forward to
the day when he, who is now rejoicing in my misfortune
as in a victory won, shall be afflicted by our returning
as one who is overcome and deprived of victory.” Then
Eve said: “Though we now depart in sorrow, Lord, because
of our great misdoing, we shall take joy in Thy
merciful lenience in our distress.” Then God disappeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>from their sight; and they began to till the earth as God
had commanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now I have done as you requested, having explained
briefly why the serpent sought speech with the woman
and what caused him to egg the woman on to violate
the law. Still, I have taken up only what is most easily
grasped in this speech; for the task of glossing our discourse
after deep meditation I prefer to leave to others.
But let us continue straight ahead in the discussion as
we have begun, since we do not have time to do both.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>XLVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A COMMENTARY ON THE STORY OF LUCIFER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I now see clearly why you regard the answers
to my last questions as glosses and interpretations of
the speeches which you gave earlier rather than a continuation
of our original plan; and I fear that, if I
should ask you to enlarge further upon this subject,
you will consider my questions unwise. But having been
granted freedom to ask about whatever I have the curiosity
to know, I shall venture another question: and I
shall continue to look for good answers as before, even
though my questions be childish. Now you have brought
out that, when the serpent spoke to the woman as he
did, it was the spirit speaking with the serpent’s tongue.
You have likewise shown me why the woman was led
into sin; that Lucifer was inspired by malicious envy
to hinder man from coming into the dominion from
which he himself had been expelled. And in your discussion
of the judgments of God you had something to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>say both about Lucifer and about Adam, which I am
not sure has often been heard before. Now if I should
on occasion recall these remarks and repeat them as I
have heard you state them, it may be that some one hearing
me will say that he has never heard this account
before; and therefore I want to ask you to tell me what
facts I could state in my reply, so that I shall not seem
to withdraw my statements on account of ignorance
but rather find such means to support them, that all
will think them true rather than false.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The glosses to a speech are like the boughs
and branches of a tree. First the roots send up a stem
which again branches out into many limbs and boughs.
And whatever limb you take, if you examine it with
proper care, you will find it joined to the stem which
originally sprang up from the roots; and all the boughs
and branches draw nourishment from the roots from
which the stem grows. But if you hew off a limb and
cast it far away from the tree, and one should find it
who knows not where it grew, it will look to him like
every other branch which he finds on his way, seeing
that he does not know where it has grown. But if he
carries it back to the stem from which it was cut and
fits it there, the branch itself will testify as to what
roots it sprang from. It is the same with the interpretation
of a sermon; if a man knows how to present a
speech properly, he will also know how to interpret it
correctly. But as I hear that some things have been introduced
into this discussion which have not often been
heard, I will now do the questioning for a while, since
I have answered more than I have asked. And first I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>wish to ask whether this speech included anything that
you already knew.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> There were a few things but not many. I have
heard it quoted from Lucifer’s words that he intended
to set his throne as high as that of God; but the answer
that God gave to this I had never heard interpreted before,
but now you have explained it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Let me ask again: who do you suppose it was
that, standing by, heard Lucifer’s boastful and treacherous
words and quoted them afterwards?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> I have never heard his name spoken and I am
not sure that they were told by any one who heard them
at the beginning.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> But this you shall know of a surety, that if
Lucifer’s words have been quoted by one who heard
them in the beginning, he surely must have heard those
replies of God also, which I have just given; and he
could have reported both speeches, had he wished, since
he heard either both or neither. But if he reported Lucifer’s
treacherous boasting as he divined it, he surely
could have thought out God’s truthful statement of his
vengeance in the same way; for either both or neither
would be true. For at the very moment when Lucifer
transgressed, whether in thought or in words, God had
already purposed all the vengeance that was to befall
him from the first hour to the last. So great and all-sufficient
are God’s thoughts and wisdom, that the vision
of the divine foresight sees in the twinkling of an eye all
the events that shall come to pass from the first hour
to the very last. But He withholds in divine patience
all the things that He intends shall come to pass, until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>suitable times appear; and He will let everything happen
as He has purposed it heretofore. Now if God should
have endowed any one with such great insight and wisdom
that he could know all the thoughts of God and
should report them as if God had disclosed them in
word or speech, he would by no means be telling falsehoods;
for all that God has purposed has been told him
in his thoughts, whether his lips have spoken about
them or not. The apostle Paul tells us that God has
given men his Holy Spirit with a definite office and activity:
some receive a spirit of prophecy, some a spirit
of knowledge and wisdom, some a spirit of eloquence,
some a spirit of understanding, and some a spirit of
skill;<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c015'><sup>[297]</sup></a> some have these gifts in large measure, others
in less; some enjoy one of these gifts, others two, still
others three, while some have all, each one as God wills
to endow him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But those who, like King David, have received both
the spirit of understanding and of eloquence, have ventured
to compose speeches and write books in order that
the speeches shall not perish. In some places David has
told of God’s purposes, in other places of His deeds,
and in still other places he has reported His words; and
those who in times past have written glosses to the
psalms which David composed have had more to say
about what was in David’s mind than about the words
that he wrote. For to every word they have added long
comments of what David had in thought when he spoke
this word; and in these comments they point out the
meaning which he had in his thoughts at every word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>that he wrote in the Psalter. In like manner they have
proceeded, who have interpreted the words of the Evangelists,
and they have brought out much that the Evangelists
have left unsaid. Thus they have shown that
their comments are on the words of thought which the
lips had left unspoken. And if one has received the
God-given spirit of a perfect understanding, he has a
gift of such a nature that, when he hears a few spoken
words, he perceives many words of thought. But David
did not himself gloss the Psalter for the reason that he
wished to leave to others the task of expressing all those
thoughts which came up in his mind, while he continued
writing the Psalms as originally planned. Thus all do
who have a speech on the tongue which ought to be interpreted:
they proceed with the discourse as planned
and begun, and leave to others the task of expressing
in words what is in their thoughts. Still, you should
know that no one has glossed the sayings of David who
sat by him, while he was composing the Psalter, and
asked what was in his mind at the time. And from this
you will perceive that it is the grace of the spirit of insight
which guides such men to examine the foundations
of the sermons that they hear. Next they investigate
how widely the roots ramify which lie beneath the
speech; they consider carefully how many limbs grow
out of it; and finally they make a count of the branches
that sprout from each limb. They also note precisely
what bough they take for themselves, that they may be
able to trace it correctly back to the roots from which it
originally grew. Now if you understand this thoroughly
and if you investigate with care and precision everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>that you hear told, you will not fall into error, no
matter whether the comments that you hear be right
or wrong, if God has given you the spirit that leads to a
right understanding. For every man who is gifted with
proper insight and gets into the right path at the beginning
will be able to find the highways of reason and
to determine what expressions are suitable and will best
fit the circumstances. Now gather from these things
whatever you can that may give insight; but it does not
seem necessary to discuss them further.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>XLIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>INSTANCES IN WHICH GOD HAS ALLOWED THE DECISION<br /> TO BE FRAMED ACCORDING TO THE STERN<br /> DEMANDS OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> God reward you, sire, for being so patient in
answering all the questions that I am asking. I find,
however, that you think my queries wander about in
a childish way, but as I cannot keep to the subject of
the conversation that we have begun, my questions will
come down here and there, as one might expect of youthful
ignorance. Still, it seems that it is better to have
asked than not about the matter that I brought up last,
namely, how one is to determine whether the glosses
are correct or not. Now I understand perfectly your
statement that a man does not tell a lie about God, if
he tells God’s purposes as if they were His own words;
for whatever God has determined in His own soul, He
has already spoken to Himself in His thoughts, whether
He has uttered them with His lips or not; wherefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>those things may be interpreted as if spoken, because in
His mind He has spoken all that to Himself. This, too,
is clear to me, that, although no one is able to divine
what God had in mind at the beginning, He has Himself
revealed it in letting those things come to pass which
He had thought and purposed; for it seems very evident
that all those things which God has allowed to occur,
He had thought upon and wisely planned in his own
mind, before they came to pass. It is also quite clear
to me that those who have added explanatory glosses
to the writings of David, or other men who have written
sermons and set them in books, have developed their
interpretations by studying out what fundamental
thought or purpose had since the beginning lain underneath
the words. Afterwards they wisely considered
this, too, with what truth probability might be able to
account for every branch and twig of that discourse,
so that the contents might be revealed. Now since these
things begin to look somewhat clearer to me, it may be
that I shall continue to reflect upon them, if God gives
me the necessary insight. But since I realize that you
feel it would be a large and tedious task both to continue
the discourse already begun and to make suitable
comments, I will now ask you to return to the subject
before us and to continue setting forth the judgment
of God, giving cases in which He allowed the sentence
to be carried out with severity according to the verdict
of Justice and Truth, and others in which He showed
greater leniency.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The following instances occurred long after the
fall but had a similar outcome. Pharaoh, the king of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Egypt, suffered a merciless doom by the judgment of
Truth and Justice.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c015'><sup>[298]</sup></a> Dathan and Abiram were justly
doomed and destroyed.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c015'><sup>[299]</sup></a> When Joshua led the people
of Israel into the land that God had promised them
God ordered him to punish the people who dwelt in the
city called Jericho with such severity that whatever
was living should perish.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c015'><sup>[300]</sup></a> Long after that, when King
Saul led an invasion into Amalek, God commanded him
to slay everything that was living; but Saul incurred
the anger of God because he did not carry out what was
commanded.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c015'><sup>[301]</sup></a> The case of Judas, one of the apostles of
God, is among the examples that belong to a much later
date: for Truth and Justice condemned him without
mercy for dastardly treachery toward his Lord. There
are many similar cases, though we have given these
only; and, inasmuch as our speech would get too long,
we cannot include in a single discourse all the examples
that we know resemble these. But when God decreed
all these punishments which we have now recounted,
the sisters were all on the judgment seat with Him,
Truth and Justice, Mercy and Peace, and they all agreed
with Him and kissed and embraced each other.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>L<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OTHER INSTANCES IN WHICH THE ARGUMENTS OF PEACE<br /> AND MERCY HAVE HAD GREATER WEIGHT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It is quite evident that in the cases which you
have now recounted, Truth and Justice had a larger
part in the verdict than Peace and Mercy. But no one
can doubt that the sisters were all agreed in these decisions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>for we may be sure that God never passes a
merciless judgment. One will consequently need to ponder
these things with careful attention and close thinking;
for the judgments of God are largely concealed from
men. Therefore I wish to ask you to point out those
cases in which Mercy and Peace have chiefly dictated
the verdict, so that I may get insight into dooms of
both kinds, seeing that examples of both are to be found.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> There are so many cases of either class, that
we cannot include all the verdicts in one discussion;
still, we can point out a few of them, in order that both
your questions may be answered. The following are
events which occurred long ago, when Aaron and Ur,
the bishops,<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c015'><sup>[302]</sup></a> committed a great sin against God in that
they gave His people two calves made of molten gold,
through which the entire nation was led astray from
the faith; for the people called these calves the gods of
Israel and brought sacrifices to them as to God. But
when Moses came down to the people (he had been up
on the mountain where he had spoken to God Himself),
the bishops ran to meet him, deeply repenting their sins;
and, falling at Moses’ feet, they begged him to intercede
for them with God, lest He be angered with them
according to their deserts. But when God saw how
deeply the bishops repented, He heard Moses’ prayer,
and the bishops retained the dignities which they had
before, and they did penance for their sin. The instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>that I have now related is one of those in which the
greater share in the decision was assigned to Peace and
Mercy, though Truth and Justice also consented to the
doom; for the bishops would have suffered death for
this offence, if Mercy had not been more lenient with
them than they deserved. The following event is like
this but happened much later: King David fell into this
great sin, that he committed adultery with Uriah’s wife
and afterwards brought about the death of Uriah himself.
After Uriah’s death David took his wife and had
her for his own, and surely he deserved death for these
sins. But he repented his misdeeds so deeply before God
and begged forgiveness so humbly for the sins confessed,
that God heard his prayer and did not take
away his kingship, but even confirmed him in it, though
he had committed these crimes.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c015'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The following events occurred much later at the time
when our Lord Jesus Christ was on earth among men.
The bishops of the Jews and all their other learned men
became very hostile toward him and were constantly
striving to find something for which they might reproach
him. So they took a woman who had openly
committed adultery and was worthy of death according
to the law of Moses; this woman they brought before
Jesus and told him of her crimes. They also said that
the law condemned her to die and asked what sentence
he would pass in this case. Jesus replied that he who
had never committed a sin should cast the first stone
upon her. Then they turned away quickly, not daring
to question him further, for they all knew themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>to have sinned. But Jesus said to the woman: “Woman,
since none of those who accused thee has passed judgment
in thy case, neither will I condemn thee to die;
go in peace, but henceforth beware of sin.” There is another
instance which is like those that I related earlier,
and which happened in the night when Jesus was seized.
His apostle Peter had boastfully protested that he would
never forsake him, though all others should leave him,
and that he would suffer death with Jesus before he
would desert him like a coward. But in the same night
when Jesus was seized, Peter denied three times that
he had been with him, and the third time he confirmed
the statement with an oath that he had not been Jesus’
man. Then he went away out of the hall where Jesus
was held and immediately began to repent his sin and
all his words and wept bitterly. Nevertheless, after
Jesus had risen, Peter’s sins were forgiven, and he retained
all the honors that had been promised him before.
There is still another event which came to pass a few
days later when our Lord was crucified. Two thieves
were crucified with him, one on either side; both had
been guilty of the same crimes, murder and robbery.
But while they hung on the cross, one of them took
thought to repent and implored mercy of Jesus, though
he, too, like the thieves, hung on a cross. His sins were
pardoned and he was given sure promise of paradise on
that very day; but his companion was condemned according
to his deeds.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE REASONS FOR THIS DIVERSITY IN THE VERDICTS OF GOD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> If earthly kings and other chiefs, who are appointed
to act as judges, are to adapt their decisions
to the examples that you have now given, they must
find it very important to learn precisely what each suit
is based upon; for in many of these instances, it looks
as if the cases were somewhat alike in appearance. Still,
all the decisions in the earlier examples led to severe
punishments, while in the later ones they all led to
mercy and forgiveness. Therefore I now wish to ask you
why Pharaoh, Dathan, and Abiram, the people who
dwelt in Jericho, and those of Amalek, who were punished
by King Saul, were all destroyed without mercy.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> These things were all done at the command
of Justice and Truth, though Peace and Mercy consented.
For Moses daily performed many miracles before
King Pharaoh and commanded him to release God’s
people; and he might have released them, had he wished,
without suffering any injury thereby. He made constant
promises that it should be done, but he never
kept either word or promise. Now it was right that he
should perish in his stubborn wickedness and evil-doing,
since he would accept neither mercy nor pardon, though
he had the opportunity. Dathan and Abiram, when
Moses told them that they had done evil, became angry
and refused to repent; and they perished without mercy
because they sought no mercy. Those who dwelt in
Jericho and Amalek had heard for many days that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>had done evil both to God’s people and against His will
but they offered no atonement; on the contrary, they
proposed to take up arms in their defense, wherefore
they were overcome by a merciless revenge. But those
whom I pointed out to you in the later accounts,
Aaron, Ur, David, and the others who were mentioned
in those examples, did not conceal their wickedness,
but confessed their misdeeds as they were; hoping for
pardon, they begged mercy and clemency, and offered
to atone, as He should determine, Who, they knew, had
the decision in His power. And they promised that
nevermore would they fall into such guilt, if they might
become fully reconciled.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c006' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I now wish to ask you why such a great distinction
was made in the cases of Peter and Judas,
though their offences appear similar. Judas returned
the money that he had received and repented his evil
deed; he confessed that he had sold his innocent Lord,
and threw away the silver, saying that he would not
keep what had come to him so wrongfully. Now he was
destroyed, though he repented; while Peter was forgiven
at once, because he repented.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Judas fell in the beginning into sin through
avarice and love of wealth and took a bribe to betray
his Lord. His repentance was such that he could not
hope for pardon, and he asked for no mercy but punished
himself with a sudden death. But Peter wept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>bitterly in his repentance, and, hoping for mercy, implored
forgiveness. Furthermore, Judas had the greater
guilt, for he sold his Lord; and though he repented, he
craved no pardon; and he did not abide the judgment
of God, but condemned himself forthwith. But Peter
denied his Lord through sudden fear and repented immediately
in great sorrow; he submitted to the judgment
of God and abided it, and did not condemn himself
as Judas did. There was a similar outcome in the
case of the crucified thieves. Though both acknowledged
the sins that they had committed, one prayed for mercy
and pardon, while the other asked no mercy but spoke
in contempt and derision rather than in prayer or serious
thought. Therefore these whom we have now named
were saved through the merciful judgments of Mercy
and Peace, though Truth and Justice agreed to the
verdicts.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>INSTANCES IN WHICH GOD HAS MODIFIED HIS SENTENCES<br /> AND THE REASONS FOR SUCH MODIFICATIONS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I am beginning to see these things more clearly
now and to understand why it is that the larger share
in a verdict is sometimes assigned to Justice and Truth
and at other times to Peace and Mercy. And now I want
to ask you to discuss those cases which you mentioned
earlier in which God modified the sentence agreed upon,
and to state the causes that led to this.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> To this class belong certain events which
occurred a long time ago in the days when Moses was
upon the mountain called Sinai. In those days the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>mass of the people sinned grievously and even fell into
whoredom, cohabiting with women of the heathen race.
But so strictly had God forbidden this, that everyone
who fell into that sin was held worthy of death. Then
God said to Moses: “Now shalt thou cease speaking
with Me that My wrath may have time to wax hot
against this people which I gave into thy charge. For
they have fallen into such grievous sins against My
commandments that I intend to consume them all in
My fierce wrath; and I will give thee another people,
far better and stronger and more numerous than this
one.” At this point it would almost seem as if a definite
sentence had been passed in the case of this nation.
Moses, however, asked permission to intercede briefly
in behalf of the people of Israel and, this being granted,
he spoke these words. “I pray Thee, O Lord, to turn
from Thy wrath and do not destroy Thy people, though
they have done ill. Let not the Egyptians have this to
say, that Thou didst lead Thy people out of Egypt and
out of their dominion to consume them in the mountains
and the desert; or that Thou wert unable to lead
Thy people into the land which Thou hadst promised
them from the beginning. Remember, O Lord, Thy servants
Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and do not destroy
the generations that have sprung from Israel’s kin
which Thou hast Thyself promised to multiply upon
earth and to lead securely into the land that is now
controlled by Thine enemies.”<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c015'><sup>[304]</sup></a> God heard the prayer
of Moses; His wrath was appeased, and He did not slay
the people as He had threatened; but He gave their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>punishment into the hands of Moses, instructing him
that they must not wholly escape chastisement, though
it should not be so severe as God had threatened earlier.
Moses returned hastily to the camp and coming upon
the people in a tempestuous spirit and in fierce wrath,
he slew many thousand men in that day, and in this
way pacified the wrath of God. Now this example shows
how God lessened a penalty imposed, in that He appeased
His wrath before Moses’ prayer. And it shows
that neither of the sisters, Truth or Justice, suffered
in her rights by this judgment, inasmuch as Moses slew
a great host to pacify the wrath of God. But Peace and
Mercy also had their rights, seeing that less was done
than had been decreed at first.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is another instance that shows how God has
modified a judgment already passed. He sent Jonah
the prophet to Niniveh with orders to tell the king and
all the people of the city that within thirty days Niniveh
should be destroyed with all that was therein.
Jonah did as God commanded and told these things as
true tidings. But when the king understood that the
people were of a truth in danger of divine wrath (for the
nation was full of whoredoms and wickedness of every
form) he descended from his throne, laid aside his royal
robes, and did penance and fasted; and he bade all
men in the city do likewise, both young and old. And
when God saw that they repented of their wickedness
with sorrow and penance in many forms, He extended
mercy and destroyed neither the city nor the people
within it.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c015'><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Here is still another instance that points to the same
result. Hezekiah was the name of a good king in the
land of Israel; he fell ill and meditated deeply about
his case, whether God intended to bring him through
this illness or to let him die. Then God sent Isaiah His
prophet to him; and God said to the prophet that Hezekiah
should die of this malady. Isaiah went to the king
and said to him: “Take good heed and set your house
in order and all your affairs, for God has said that you
shall die of this illness and not live.” As soon as Isaiah
had spoken these words to the king, he departed; but
the king turned his face to the wall and prayed for deliverance
in these words: “Remember, O Lord, how
steadfast I have been in Thy service, for I have always
opposed Thine enemies, and this people that Thou hast
given into my keeping have I turned from much wickedness
which many of them practiced before I came to the
kingship. And there are three reasons why I am loath
to die so suddenly now of this illness. The first, which
I fear the most, is that I may not have kept Thy commandments
fully, and if I die in a state of sin I may
look for Thy vengeance in my death. The second is that
I have not yet turned all Thy people wholly away from
their evil ways; and I fear, if I die suddenly now, that
they will soon return to their old abominations. The
third, which I fear much, is the victory of Thine enemies
over Thy people, seeing that my son is a child; and
his power to defend the people against Thine enemies
may prove less than is required. But if Thou wilt hear
my prayer, O Lord, and add a few days to my life, all
these things may be brought into a better state than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>they are at present.” God heard Hezekiah’s prayer and
said to Isaiah the prophet: “Return quickly to King
Hezekiah and tell him different tidings now from what
thou toldest before; for I have heard his prayer, and I
will add unto the days of his life fifteen years beyond
what I had intended for him, and I will deliver all his
realm from the attack of his adversaries.”<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c015'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Here is another instance which belongs to a much
later time. In the days when Jesus Christ was here upon
earth among men, one of his friends, Lazarus by name,
fell ill and died of the illness. Bethany was the name of
the town where Lazarus was buried. But when he had
lain four days in the grave, Jesus came to Bethany.
Now it would seem in Lazarus’ case, as in that of all
others who have departed from this world, that an irrevocable
sentence had been passed, seeing that he had
lain four days a dead man in the earth, death having
even appointed him a place in his kingdom. Jesus ordered
Lazarus’ grave to be opened, and calling him he
commanded him to tear himself away from the hands
of his dead companions. Thereupon Lazarus rose from
the dead, and he lived many days after that. There are
many other examples of this kind, but these are the
ones which we have preferred to bring to light; and since
our talk has been quite long, it seems unnecessary to
recount others, though they are plentiful.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>LIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE KING’S PRAYER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> The more examples I hear, the more evident is
the truth of what you stated earlier in your remarks,
namely that it is very necessary for kings and other
rulers who are in charge of justice to be widely informed,
if they are to adapt their verdicts to the examples that
we have now heard.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> You should understand this clearly that,
since the king holds his title from God, it is surely his
duty to suit his decisions to divine examples; and the
same is true of all who are appointed to pass judgment,
both clerks and laymen. For we no longer have opportunity
to ask counsel on any point from God’s own lips,
as Moses could; wherefore men should live according
to the examples that were set in those days when it was
possible to inquire of God Himself what His will was
on any matter. Therefore, a king ought to keep these
examples frequently upon his lips and before his eyes,
and such other examples, too, as may give insight for
his own decisions. The most favorable time for such
meditation is at night or in the early morning when he
is sated with sleep. But when the hour to rise comes and
it is time for the king to hear the hours, it is his duty
to go to church and listen attentively to the mass and
to join in the prayers and in chanting the psalms if he
knows them. Like every other Christian man who is at
prayers, the king ought to attend with as much devotion
as if he stood in the presence of God and spoke to God
Himself. He should call to mind the words that David
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>uttered when he spoke in this wise: “I shall ever see
the Lord before my face, for He is always at my right
hand.”<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c015'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A king should begin his prayer by showing God that
he holds the true faith. Next he should make clear that
he gives thought to his earthly dominion and the divine
power of God. Thereupon he must confess his sins and
misdeeds to God, making clear to Him that he does not
consider himself as having come without guilt or as if
defending his cause. Next he must beg mercy and forgiveness
for the transgressions that he has confessed.
He must also show God humbly that he regards himself
as coming before His knees as a thrall or a servant,
though God has exalted him to power among men. He
must not fail to remember others besides himself in
prayer: his queen, if he has one, who is appointed to
rule and defend the land with him; his bishops and all
other learned men who are to aid him in maintaining
Christianity, and, therefore, owe the duty to offer
prayers for him and for all the other people of the kingdom.
He ought also to remember all his other lords and
knights in his prayer and all the warriors who assist
him in the government. Likewise he must remember
the husbandmen, the householders, and all his other
subjects who maintain his kingdom by labor or other
gainful effort. He should, therefore, remember all, men
and women, for it is their duty to offer up holy prayers
for him every day. And, if he likes, he may use daily
the following prayer, which is in the form that I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>given, but he must pray as devoutly as if he were speaking
to God Himself; and these are the words of the

<p class='c010'>“O Thou most merciful God, eternal Father! O Thou
most honored Conqueror, Jesus Christ, the only begotten
Son of God! O Thou most gentle Comforter, Holy
Spirit! O Thou perpetual fount of wisdom and complete
and unshaken faith, Holy Trinity! O Thou indivisible
Unity, one omnipotent, unchangeable God: Thou Who
sittest above the highest summits of heaven and lookest
into the hidden depths below! For no creature can
escape Thy dominion, though it should wish to flee from
Thy wrath. Even though I should mount to heaven,
Thou art there before me; and though I crawl down into
the lowest hiding places of hell, Thy spiritual dominion
is there; and though I were to fly upon the wings of
the winds and hide beyond the uttermost boundaries of
the ocean solitudes, even there Thy right hand would
seize me and lead me back into Thy control. For Thy
mind has numbered the sands driven by the winds and
by the power of the ocean about all the earth, and Thine
eye knows all the drops of the dewy rain. Therefore, I
implore Thee, O my Lord, do not enter into the seat of
judgment with me, Thy servant, to search out my righteousness;
and do not number the multitude of my sins,
but turn Thy face away from mine iniquities and cleanse
me from my secret faults and wash away all my guilt.
For my sins are great and lie heavy upon my head; they
are so many that they seem numberless to me in their
multitude,—sins that I have committed in vain thinking,
in foolish words, in neglecting Thy commandments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>and forgetting Thy holy law in every way, in indiscreet
testimony and thoughtless oaths, in judging unjustly
between men, in excessive avarice, and in all manner
of useless and evil works. I acknowledge and confess to
Thee, O Lord, calling all Thy saints to witness, that I
am so guilty of misdeeds and evil works, that I am already
condemned by the multitude of my transgressions,
unless I may share in the benefits of the exceeding abundance
of Thy mercy and of the good and meritorious
intercessions of my Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, and of
all the saints in whom Thou hast been well pleased since
the world began. For the misdeeds and all the iniquity
that I have committed from my childhood to this day
are uncovered and revealed unto Thee, even though I
might wish to conceal and not confess them; for short-sighted
frailty was not ashamed to pursue its evil desires
before Thy face. But, O Lord, inasmuch as Thou
dost not delight in them who are destroyed in sin, but
wouldst rather that they should live and be led aright,
and because Thou knowest that man is frail and without
strength like the dust of the earth or the crumbling
leaf, unless Thou strengthen him with the power of Thy
mercy, therefore, I implore Thee, do not punish me
with the swift judgment of Thy wrath; but let Thy
divine patience give me time and will to repent and
ability to do penance. Take away from me, O Lord,
envy and pride, despair and stubbornness, injustice and
violence, and detestable gluttony; cleanse me from the
seven cardinal sins and the cursed vices which spring
from them. Give me, O Lord, love and constant hope,
true faith and humility, wisdom and justice, and ample
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>strength to do Thy will at all times. Give me the seven
cardinal gifts of the Holy Spirit with all the blessed
fruitage that grows out of these; for I am Thy handiwork,
created in Thine image, Thy thrall begotten in
sin by Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaiden. But
Thy mercy has appointed me to Thine office and has
exalted me, though unworthy, to the royal dignity and
the sacred chieftainship; and Thou hast appointed me
to judge and to govern Thy holy people. Therefore, I
pray Thee, give more heed to the needs of Thy holy
people, which Thou hast appointed me to rule over, than
to my merits; but give me the right understanding, self-control
and sense of justice, eloquence, purpose, and
good intentions, so that I may be able to judge and determine
the causes of rich and poor in such a way that
Thou wilt be pleased, while they rejoice that justice is
done among them. And I pray Thee, O Lord! to pour
out Thy spirit of upright understanding upon all my
councillors and helpers who assist me in maintaining
the government. To my queen, whom Thou hast joined
to me with the bonds of marriage, and above all to the
hallowed stewards and servants of holy church, the
most eminent priest, the bishop of Rome, and all our
bishops, abbots, and rulers, to our priests and to all the
learned men who are in their charge,—to all these, O
Lord, give a chaste and upright spirit, so that they may
show their good works and set Thy people good examples
and give them right instruction. To the governors
and to all those who assist me in guiding and
defending the realm, give rightmindedness, abhorrence
of evil ways, and the appreciation and love of good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>morals. Make mine enemies truly repentant of their
evil and wickedness, cause them to desist from their
ferocity, and turn them to a true friendship. To Thy
people and all the commonalty give knowledge and a
will to love Thee, the true God, a right obedience to
their superiors, good peace and rich harvests, and security
from enemies. Remember, O Lord, in Thy holy
mercy, all the races of mankind for whom our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thine only begotten son, shed his blood
in redemption, whether they be still living in this world
or called home in holy patience by Thy commands. To
those, O Lord, who are blinded by error and ignorance
and therefore cannot discern Thy Holy Trinity, send
Thy spirit of insight, that they may know and understand
that Thou art the true God and none other; for
no one may approach Thee except Thy holy compassion
draws him to Thy love. And be not wroth with me, Thy
servant, O Lord, because I have dared to speak with
Thee at this time, even though I continue in prayer, but
incline Thy compassionate ear and hear and grant what
I pray for in Thine abundant kindness. I pray Thee, O
Lord, never to give me into the hands of mine enemies
because of my misdeeds, or to let me become their victim
or captive, and never to let mine enemies rejoice in
my misfortunes, whether in body or in spirit, visible or
invisible; but if I do aught against Thy holy will and
commandments, take me in Thy right hand and chastise
me, though not according to my deserts but according
to the lenient judgment of Thy mercy; and give me
abundant power and resolute strength to oppose all
antagonism and all deception. Let me suffer no greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>temptations than my weakness can resist; let me not
end my days in a sudden death; and do not call me out
of this world before I shall have repented and rightly
atoned for all my sins; and when the strivings of this
world have ceased, let me rest eternally with Thee and
Thy saints. And from my heart I pray Thee, O Lord, to
give me a lawful heir begotten of my loins, whom it may
please Thee in Thy mercy to set after my time in the
seat of honor where Thou hast placed me; and let my
high-seat never pass into the power of other dynasties,
but only to such as shall spring from me, the son inheriting
from the father in every case. And grant, O
Lord, I pray Thee, that no branches that have sprung
from me shall wither or decay; and let them not follow
after foolish men into error and neglect, but give them
insight and wisdom to understand and to know Thy
sacred law, and power and a good purpose to love Thee
and Thy commands. For Thou only art the true God,
Who liveth and reigneth forever, world without end.
Amen.”<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c015'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Now this prayer that you have just heard is one which
the king may offer up, if he wishes, with such other
psalms and prayers as he knows. And though he may
not always repeat this prayer, he should, nevertheless,
pray according to the plan that is outlined in this prayer.
And this I verily believe to be his duty every day, until
he has heard the hours and the mass, if he means to
observe what belongs to his dignity and to his official
duties.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE KING’S BUSINESS ESPECIALLY HIS JUDICIAL DUTIES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I believe you have now cleared up for me what
you think ought to be a king’s business, at night after
the season for sleep is past while he is meditating upon
the needs of his realm and subjects, and in the morning
when he goes to church or to devotional services; and
it seems to me that these occupations are both useful
and important, so much so that they are indispensable.
Now that you have shown me what he should be employed
with in the night and early in the morning, I
wish to ask you to continue and to point out what he
should be occupied with during the day: whether it is
your opinion that he should ponder the needs of his
kingdom while awake at night in order that he may be
able to spend the day with greater freedom, after the
custom which I hear that kings now follow in most
places, either in riding out with hawks or in joining the
chase with dogs, or in some other form of diversion, as
I hear that kings are in the habit of doing in most countries;
or whether you think that he should be otherwise
employed, if he does as he ought to do, and that kings
seek these diversions more for the sake of recreation
than because their rank demand it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I surely do believe, with respect to what you
have just asked about, that kingship was established
and appointed to look after the needs of the whole realm
and people rather than for sport and vain amusements.
Nevertheless, a king must be allowed to seek diversion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>now and then, either with hawks, hounds, horses, or
weapons, so that his health and agility at arms or in any
form of warfare may be preserved. His chief business,
however, is to maintain an intelligent government and
to seek good solutions for all the difficult problems and
demands which come before him. And you shall know
of a truth that it is just as much the king’s duty to observe
daily the rules of the sacred law and to preserve
justice in holy judgments as it is the bishop’s duty to
preserve the order of the sacred mass and all the canonical
hours.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> I am inquiring so closely into these things for
the reason that many believe the royal dignity to have
been founded for such pleasure-giving splendor and unrestrained
amusement as kings may desire. But now I
see clearly from your remarks that a king ought constantly
to labor in the yoke of God; wherefore it seems
to me that he must have a great burden to support
every day in the serious interest that he must show when
the needs of his subjects are presented to him. Therefore
I wish to ask you once more to show me clearly what
should be a king’s duty after the hours have been observed.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It was the custom of old at the time when the
royal office was established and enjoyed its greatest
splendor, that, when a king no longer stood in fear of
his enemies but sat in complete security among his
henchmen, he selected a splendid house where he could
set up his high-seat, which was also to serve as his judgment
seat; and this throne he adorned with every form
of royal decoration. Then the king sat down upon it and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>observed in what glory and splendor he sat. Next he
began to ponder in what way he must occupy this glorious
high-seat, so as not to be driven from it with dishonor
in spite of his exalted position either because of
injustice or malice, indiscretion or folly, inordinate ambition,
arrogance, or excessive timidity. Now it looks
most reasonable to me that, whereas kingship was originally
established in this way as we have just pointed
out, a king should continue to maintain the arrangement
which was made in the beginning. And as soon as the
king comes into this seat which we have just mentioned
and has reflected upon all those things which we have
just told about, it becomes his duty to pass judgment
in the suits and on the needs of his people, if they are
presented to him. But when there is no official business
brought before him, he should meditate on the source
of holy wisdom and study with attentive care all its
ways and paths.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SPEECH OF WISDOM</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I beg you, sire, not to be displeased with me,
though I ask thoughtless and stupid questions; but it
looks to me like a difficult task to search out the very
sources of wisdom and learn its ways and paths. And
therefore I wish to ask you to tell me something about
this form of study, so that I may, if possible, derive
some insight from it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It ought not to cause displeasure to have one
inquire closely into subjects which one is not likely to
understand without some direction. But God’s mercy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>reveals and makes known many things to mankind
which would be largely hidden from them, if He were
unwilling to have them revealed. And many things
which were formerly concealed in His own knowledge
He has made known to us, because He wishes man to
take a profitable interest in the wealth of knowledge
which he draws from the divine treasures. But as a
guide toward this interest which we have just mentioned
one should take special note of the words that Wisdom
used concerning herself when she spoke in these
terms:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am begotten of God’s own heart; I have proceeded
from the mouth of the Highest; and I have ordered all
things.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c015'><sup>[309]</sup></a> The spirit of God moved over empty space, and
we separated light from darkness; we appointed hours
and times, days and nights, years and winters and everlasting
summer. We built a star-lit throne for the King
of heaven; yea, God did nothing except in my far-seeing
presence. Together we weighed the lightness of the air
and the gravity of the earth; we hung the ponderous
sphere of earth in the thin air and strengthened the firmament
of heaven with mighty forces. We commanded
the blazing sun to adorn the brow of day with shining
beams; but the inconstant moon we bade illumine the
darkness of night with its pale sheen. We created a
comely man in our image. God also beautified the face
of the earth with trees and herbs yielding manifold
fruits; He called forth the beauties of the sky in the
form of birds of many kinds; and he concealed multitudes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>of fishes of many sorts in the depths of the waters.
He also commanded the four-footed beasts to multiply
upon earth into many and divers species. He girded the
entire circle of the earth with a roaring ocean and briny
streams. He commanded fresh waters to flow forth in
steep cascades over the face of the land, and built the
foundations of the earth with numerous passages, that
the flowing waters might always be able to fulfil the
duties assigned them; and He commanded the light
vapors to carry heavy waters through the heights of
the air by means of enticing warmth. Further He
bade the wind-swollen clouds pour forth cool showers
over the face of the earth. And the Maker of all things
bade me oversee the whole artifice of the divine handiwork.
Then I moved briskly with treading foot over the
mountain top; I fared lightly over smooth vales and
level fields; I strode with toilsome and heavy step over
the rough billows; and I measured the width of the level
ocean with gentle tread. Pressing forward with stiffened
knee, I walked upon the wings of the stormy winds.
With gentle speech I taught the silent calm its pleasing
manner. I traced my path through the heights of heaven
and the expanse of the air; I scanned the curved circle
of the restless ocean; and I paced and measured the entire
globe of the sphere-shaped earth. I traveled over
hills and mountains; I ran over fields and meadows and
level valleys; and I gave honey-like dew to all the blossoming
herbs. I passed among thorns and bushes and
through forests of every kind and gave sweet blossoms
to the fruit-bearing trees. I pitched my tent in a shadowless
beam of light and went forth from this fair shelter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>arrayed like a bridegroom and glad like a mighty giant
rejoicing in the race.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c015'><sup>[310]</sup></a> But mortal idols envied me, found
me guilty, and condemned me to die. In wrath I descended
to the lowest valleys and overturned the strongholds
of the mighty ones in mine anger. With violence
I shattered the metal gates of the strong castles and
broke the firm iron pillars and the thick bars of iron.
I took gold and gems and jewels, the plunder of warfare,
and then journeyed gladly to the higher abodes with
priceless booty. I traveled through farms and villages
and parishes offering the poor a share in my wealth. I
offered the husbandman fruitful corn and partnership
with me. I comfort the sorrowing; I give rest to the
weary, drink to the thirsty, and food to the hungry.
Happy is he who drinks from my cup, for my beverage
has an unfailing sweetness. I journey through castles
and cities and marts; I run over houses, markets, and
streets; I call with a clear and friendly voice, offering
food, entertainment, and harmless amusement. Happy
is he who goes to my table, for my meat has a more
pleasing savour than the sweetest perfume; my drink is
sweeter than honey and clearer than any wine; tuneful
music is heard at my table in sweet and beautiful
melody; there are songs and poems such as rarely are
heard, merriment and gladness, and pure joy unmixed
with grief. Happy is he who shall live in my house, for
in my house are seven great pillars which join together
the entire vault under a good roof; they stand upon a
floor placed on immovable foundations and they fortify
all the walls with great strength. In each of these pillars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>may be found the seven liberal arts of study. Furthermore,
my house is strewn with fragrant grasses and
lovely herbs; it is hung with beauty and elegance, and
splendor in every form. Among the humble I am a
pleasant companion, but toward the proud I am stern
and haughty. In every school I am the principal teacher
and I am the highest form of eloquence in every law
court. I am the wisest among lawyers and the chief
justice on every bench. Happy is he who is found to be
a sincere companion of mine; for I am constantly with
my companions guarding them from all perils. Happy
is he who suffers no disgrace from me, for my wrath
kindles a fire in its passion which burns even to the
lowest depths; some day it will consume the foundations
of the hills and swallow up the earth with its
teeming life. Where can he hide who seeks to escape
from me? The spirit of God fills the entire home-circle
and searches out the meaning and the interpretation of
all knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The speech that you have now heard is one which
Wisdom has spoken about herself; there are others like
it, but loftier, which are not repeated here. For King
Solomon and Jesus the son of Sirach have written with
much skill a great many sermons of the kind that Wisdom
has spoken about herself in divers ways. But if
we were to mention all the speeches that can be found
in their writings, our conversation would suffer a great
delay; and it seems unnecessary at this time to bring
into our talk any lengthy discussion of those things
that Wisdom has said about herself. However, it is the
duty of every king to know thoroughly all the accounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>that Wisdom has given of herself or wise men like those
just mentioned have written, and each day to ponder
some part of those speeches, if the duties of his office
leave him any time for that.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>DIFFICULT DUTIES OF THE KING’S JUDICIAL OFFICE WITH ILLUSTRATIONS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Since it clearly is the official duty of a king to be
well informed in all science, it is quite evident that to
acquire the knowledge which you have just now discussed
must be of the highest importance; for it seems
likely that he will be able to gather much insight from
it, whether he wishes to meditate on the greatness of
divine power or on the needs of men. Now since you do
not care to discuss these matters further, I will ask you
to continue your remarks with a few words about what
a king ought to consider before passing judgments,
when he comes into the judgment seat to determine
the causes of men.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It is indeed his duty, as you have remarked, to
look carefully into all those speeches that we have now
spoken and to study them thoroughly, for this reason,
that if he unravels them with care in his thoughts, he
will surely find in them, if he has understanding, nearly
all those things which pertain to divine power and which
show how God has distributed his gifts among men and
other created beings. For every king and every other
discreet man can learn in this way what he actually is,
and what he ought to be, if he wishes to achieve what
God has intended for him. You also ask how a king
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>should weigh the judgments that he renders in the disputes
of men; but I have given a brief reply to that
question in an earlier talk, when I told how God passed
judgment after His covenant with Adam was broken,
and what judges He brought with Him to the judgment
seat. I also gave many examples to show how
God ordered His verdicts in certain cases of a later
time, those of King Pharaoh and all the others who
were named later in that conversation; and every king
ought surely to weigh what is found in those examples.
He must also consider with care whether a case calls
for severity and punishment or whether the doom
should be tempered; for the judgments ought not to be
equally severe in all cases. And every sentence should
be kept within the bounds of justice and fairness; and
here I may cite another example, if you like.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is something told of a certain king, which I
find most fitting to illustrate this point. This king was
a man of fame and power, thoroughly learned in all
knowledge and just in all his decisions. Every day there
came before him a large number of men whose difficulties
he had to settle; and every day he sat a long
time on the judgment seat to determine the suits of
his people, and with him sat the wise men, whom he
had found to be the most discreet and best prepared
for such duties. But whenever the king sat in this
assembly with the wise men whom he had summoned
to serve with him, armed knights stood about the
house to make sure that he could sit in perfect security.
The king had many sons, one of whom, however, was
the dearest of all; for this son loved especially to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>near his father whenever possible, and he frequently
sat on the judgment seat with him. It was in the king’s
nature to be slow in reaching decisions; and it was said
among men of quick minds that he would surely be
able to settle the law suits and speak his verdicts more
promptly, if he were truly wise. This remark was approved
by the king’s son and by many others among
the wise men; and so often was the saying repeated
that the king himself got news of it. Now it happened
at one time that the king was indisposed after a bleeding;
and just then a number of men came to bring their
disputes before the king. He then sent for his son, the
one who was in the habit of sitting in judgment with
him, and said to him: “Summon the wise men who
are accustomed to sit in judgment with me and go into
my judgment hall and take my seat for to-day, and determine
as many of the law suits as you possibly can
get over.” It was done as the king commanded. And
when the cases were presented to those men, it looked
to them as if they could decide the suits in a hurry.
But when the king’s son was ready to determine the
disputes which had been brought before him, he thought
he saw three young men coming forward, handsome
yet terrible in appearance. Two of them sat down at
his feet, one on either side. One was occupied with a set
of writings in which were written out all the cases that
were to be settled that day, one case in each document.
The other was busy with balances; and these appeared
so delicate that, if a little hair was laid upon them, they
would be disturbed. The one who had the balances
held them up, while the other, who had the documents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>laid the writings which favored him who had brought
the suit into one scale and the writing in his behalf
who was to reply in the other; but it looked as if the
scales would never balance. Then the king’s son thought
he saw that certain documents were brought out in
which the decisions and formal verdicts were drawn
up, just as he had intended to render judgment and
all the wise men had advised. But even after these
writings had been laid in the scales, they were as far
from balancing as before. When the king’s son saw
these things, he looked to see what the third young
man was doing, and saw that he stood near with a
drawn sword as if ready to strike. The sword was keen-edged
and terrible, and the edges looked to him as if
they were both on fire. Then he saw clearly that, if he
passed judgment before the scales balanced, the sword
of the young man would immediately smite his neck.
Just then he glanced down before his feet, and there
he saw the earth open downwards; underneath he saw
the gaping jaws of hell, as if waiting for him to come
there. But when he saw these things, he ceased speaking
and rendering judgments. When the wise men reminded
him that there were suits to be settled, he called
them to him, and everyone who came saw all these
things that we have now described. After that none
dared to pronounce judgment, for the scales of the
young man never balanced, and no suit was settled on
that day. But thereafter no man thought it strange if
the king was slow in pronouncing his decisions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another and similar example is found in what I told
you earlier in our conversation, when we spoke about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>a city in Ireland called Themar;<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c015'><sup>[311]</sup></a> and I shall repeat
that story in part, if you wish. This was the leading
city in Ireland and the king had his chief residence
there; and no one knew of a finer city on earth. Though
the inhabitants were heathen at that time and did not
know the true faith about God, they were firm in the
belief that there could be no deviation from righteousness
in judgment on the part of the king who dwelt in
Themar; for no decision was pronounced in Ireland
which they could consider just before the king at Themar
had passed upon it. Now at one time it came to
pass that a case was brought before the king who sat
in Themar in which his friends and kinsmen were interested
on the one side, while men whom the king disliked
had a part on the other side; and the king shaped
the verdict more according to his own will than to
justice. And this soon became evident, for three days
later the royal hall and all the other houses that the
king occupied were overturned, so that the foundations
pointed upward, while the walls and the battlements
pointed down into the earth; and the inhabitants immediately
began to desert the city and it was never
occupied after that. Now from these accounts you are
to conclude that God permits such things to be revealed
to men, because He wishes them to understand
that such an outcome is daily prepared in a spiritual
and invisible manner for men who refuse to render just
and right judgments, if they are appointed to determine
the suits of men.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> These examples apply very well to such men as
are avaricious or obstinate or both.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> You shall know of a truth, that wherever justice
is sold for money or is stricken down by arrogance,
divine revenge and punishment, physical or spiritual,
will surely come; and an instance of this can be cited,
if it is desired. There was a prominent citizen in Athens
named Stephen; he was judge in all those cases that
arose within the city; he was not known as an unjust
man. Now it came to pass that Stephen departed this
life, and two groups of angels came to meet him, the
one wishing to support his cause, the other charging
him with much and heavy guilt and wishing to lead
him with them to death. But whereas a dispute arose
between them and neither side would yield, one of the
angels proposed that they should lead Stephen before
the Judge and let the dispute be settled by His judgment.
When they came into court, the accusing lawyers
cried out saying that they had a grave charge against
Stephen, namely, that he had taken a plot of ground
from the church of Saint Lawrence by an unjust decree.
But the judge said that the saint should decide that
case, seeing that he was the one robbed. Now just as
Saint Lawrence came up to hear how the suit was going
forward, one of the angels said to Stephen: “Why do
you not call the holy priest Justin, whom you honored
so highly as to have a chapel built for him near your
hall and whom you have served in many things? He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>surely will be able to assist you somewhat in these your
troubles.”<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c015'><sup>[312]</sup></a> Justin came at the moment when the suit
was being brought up before Saint Lawrence; and after
the case had been stated, the saint asked why Stephen
had plundered him and deprived his church of land.
Stephen replied that he did not render that unjust decision
purposely, but really thought it was a just decision.
Then Saint Lawrence gripped Stephen in the
side and pinched him very hard. But Justin interceded
for him, begging the saint to show mercy in this cause,
both because of his intercession and because Stephen
did not know that he had given an unjust decision.
While Saint Lawrence was pinching his side, Stephen
had a feeling that even if he were to suffer torture for
a similar space of time in hell, he would find it no more
painful than the clutching of Saint Lawrence. But as
soon as Justin interceded for Stephen, the saint released
him and forgave the offence.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c015'><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>When the prosecutors heard that this indictment had
failed, they shouted even more loudly, saying that they
had still greater charges against Stephen. So they set
forth that a Roman whose name was Tarquin had come
to Athens, and since he was an alien and had no kindred
there, he thought that he might need help from Stephen
in his important affairs, seeing that Stephen was judge
and ruler over the whole city; and he gave Stephen a
fine horse on condition that he was to have justice and
equity. Then the Judge decreed that, if Stephen had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>sold justice for money, he should follow that profit to
destruction. But when Stephen was questioned whether
this charge was true or not, he denied the accusation
and declared that he could not remember ever having
taken fee or gift for justice. Now since Stephen had
denied the charge, it was ordered that Tarquin himself
should be called to straighten the matter. When Tarquin
came, he declared that this was not a true charge against
Stephen; for he asserted that Stephen had never taken
fees for justice so far as he knew. “But having come
there a stranger,” said Tarquin, “I thought that I
might need the good will of such a man and gave him
the horse on my own volition and not at his request.”
When the accusers heard that they would surely fail
in this indictment too, they cried even more loudly,
saying that they had a new charge against Stephen,
much greater than either of the others. They asserted
that he had arbitrarily and illegally saved three men
from the death penalty, whom both law and equity and
a just sentence would have condemned. When Stephen
was asked whether he was guilty of this charge, he admitted
that he had saved the men from death, but declared
that he had always regretted having saved them
by arbitrary and illegal means. Then the Judge decreed
that, if he had rescued men from death by violence
whom justice had condemned to die, he must suffer
death for it, unless he would do penance where the
offence was committed. Then the priest Justin asked
Saint Lawrence to help in Stephen’s defense, seeing
that he had forgiven him the matter that he had against
him and no indictment had been found true except the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>one that was now being considered. So Lawrence and
Justin went in haste to the queen and, falling at her
feet, begged her to request this favor, that the verdict
be modified so that Stephen might be allowed to do
penance in the place where he had offended. When the
queen interceded for Stephen, her request was granted.
Thereupon he was brought back to Athens, and he arose
at the moment when his body was to be carried to the
grave. He lived three winters after that and did penance
for his guilt according to the instruction of the bishop
who was in charge of that city.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are many such examples that could be brought up
in this talk, if it were thought necessary; and you should
now conclude from what I set forth in my last speech
that the judgments passed here must be carefully scrutinized,
and that it is very important for those who are
appointed to be judges to make sure whether the decisions
are properly stated and the findings correct. For
you heard how precisely the decrees were weighed before
the king’s son, when the scales were held up before
him but would never balance; and how he was threatened
with death, if he should pronounce a different
judgment from the one that would balance the scales.
You also heard how God punished the king and the
city of Themar, because the king had distorted a just
decision. Though the people did not hold the true faith
about God, He punished the deed nevertheless, because
they believed that a wrong decision could never come
from Themar. And in the last example you heard how
Stephen was held to account for all the dooms that he
had pronounced, and suffered a reprimand for having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>taken a gift from a friend; and he was condemned to
die for having saved men from death, though many
would regard that as a good rather than an evil deed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>WHEN JUDGMENTS SHOULD BE SEVERE AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE MERCIFUL</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> The more examples of this sort I hear, the more
difficult seems the position of those who are appointed
to judge. I will ask you, therefore, to indicate some test
by which I can know when the judgments ought to be
severe and when they should be more lenient.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It is difficult to state that in definite terms:
still, all causes that are brought before the men who have
authority to judge will be decided in some way. But I
believe that a purpose to judge as they think is right
will do the most to keep them from falling into guilt
before God. For Stephen was acquitted of the charge
that he had caused the church of Saint Lawrence to
forfeit land by the fact that he did not know that his
decision was wrong; and yet he did not wholly escape
punishment, though in some respects he was punished
less than he would have been, if he had known that his
verdict was wrong. Now there are four things which he
who goes into the judgment hall must leave outside
and never allow to come into the judgment seat with
him or even inside the door. The first is avarice; the
second, enmity; the third, obstinacy; the fourth, friendship.
For you heard that Stephen was ordered to disclose
whether he had accepted a gift from Tarquin and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>had promised to secure justice for him in return for the
fee. And the judgment was, that if he had sold justice
for money, he should follow the fee to destruction. You
heard this, too, that he was condemned to die for having
saved men from death by force and in defiance of
law. You also heard in the earlier account how the king
and the city of Themar perished because the king, being
friendly to one side and very hostile to the other, had
distorted a just decision. Now for such reasons those
four things must be excluded, lest any one of them
should cause a righteous doom to be distorted.</p>

<p class='c010'>You have also asked when the sentence should be
lenient and when severe, and that question can now
be answered in a few words. Careful account should
be taken of the circumstances of the man’s case who
is accused. If a charge is brought against one who is
anxious to keep the peace but is driven to violence by
the selfishness and arrogance of another, and, regretting
his guilt, is anxious to atone for it,—if such are the
circumstances, there should be lenient judgment in his
case. Likewise, if a man breaks the law who is ignorant
and does not know that he is transgressing, and would
not have done the deed had he known it to be contrary
to law, his case, too, calls for a lenient sentence. Even
when the ugliest cases that are known among men, such
as theft and robbery, come up, one should investigate
how the crime came about. If a man is so hard bestead
that he can get no food either by begging or buying
and cannot get work, while hunger and his physical
nature drive him beyond endurance, the judge should
be lenient with him, even though he be taken in guilt;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>and whenever necessity drives a man into crime and
law-breaking, the judgment should be tempered.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, if the accused are men who have been led
into crime by insolence, ambition, avarice, or selfishness,
the dooms ought to be severe, though justice and the
law of the land must be observed in every instance. And
in cases like those to which we have just referred the
sentence should be as severe as the law permits; while
in the cases mentioned earlier the law should be applied
with due allowance for the difficulties that were at hand.
If the distress that led to the trouble is considered great,
the judgment should be tempered accordingly. But if a
king or any ruler who is a judge and has power to punish,
takes life as a punishment, he should always do it
with great reluctance, in his heart lamenting the death
and ill-fortune of the offender. He must take heed, however,
lest he slay out of his own cruelty or in anger and
hatred for the one who is to die. Let him slay him in
just punishment and out of love for those who live
after; because he believes that they will live in greater
security and lead better lives after having seen the
death and troubles of such a one; and because he intends
that the fear and terror which the misfortunes of
another have brought upon him shall guide those to
rectitude and good morals, whom nature is unable to
guide because of their excessive ambition or stupidity.
A famous man, an upright and excellent emperor, once
ordained respecting the decrees of kings, that if a king
should become so angry with any one that he planned
his death, and if his guilt were not so evident that he
could with justice be condemned at once to an immediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>death, that man should be kept in the king’s garth
or in custody forty days before his case should be finally
determined.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c015'><sup>[314]</sup></a> And it would be well if every king would
observe this enactment, in order that he might frame
his decisions with regard for reason and justice and not
in sudden anger. If a man is convicted of an offence
for which law and justice impose a fine but not death,
the king, or the lord who governs the land, shall seize
his wealth, not because he loves and covets the money,
but because a just penalty and the laws of the land demand
it. If all these things which we have now set forth
are carefully observed, I believe that those who are
appointed to be judges will suffer no great reproaches
from God.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> It seems reasonable that a land, which is placed
in charge of a ruler who attends carefully to these things,
will be well governed; and the people ought to show
proper appreciation of his government. Still with your
permission I shall now ask about certain matters that
interest me concerning rightful verdicts. You referred
to an order given by an emperor as to punishments decreed
by a king (which looks to me like good law), that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>a man who had incurred the king’s wrath should be
given a reprieve of forty days in the king’s custody, lest
a verdict be rendered too quickly in his case and in
violent anger; and it seems to me that a king will need
to possess much good nature, if he is to spare a man in
his anger. But even so righteous and holy a man as
Moses was could not control his wrath on that day,
when he came in anger to the people of Israel; for I am
told that his wrath rose to such violence that he dashed
the two tables of stone, which he bore in his arms and
upon which God Himself had written the ten commandments
of His law with His own fingers, against a rock
and broke them into fragments in his fury; and rushing
at once to arms, he and the men who were with him
slew many hundred persons that day.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c015'><sup>[315]</sup></a> I have also heard
that David in sudden wrath ordered the man, who came
from the battle in which Saul fell, bringing the tidings
that Saul was dead, to be slain immediately;<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c015'><sup>[316]</sup></a> and he
did not order him to be kept for further inquiry.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Remember what I called to your attention
in an earlier remark, namely, that these laws are intended
for men who do not fall into such evident transgressions
that a rightful verdict can condemn them to
immediate death. But when Moses came away from
God, he knew God’s wrath toward all the people of
Israel, and consequently did a deed of kindness and not
of hatred when by this chastisement he turned them
from error and evil ways; just as I have told you that
a king in punishing should be moved by kindness and
not by hatred. For all penalties that are inflicted because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>of hatred are murder; while punishment inflicted
for the sake of love and justice is a holy deed and not
murder.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>CONCERNING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Now, if you permit, I wish to ask more fully
about penalties; for few men, indeed, are able to comprehend
how it can be a good, holy, and loving deed to
take a man’s life; wherefore I with many others on the
outside should like to have you explain briefly how it
can be a good and proper deed to slay men in righteous
punishment; inasmuch as all gentle and peaceful persons
have a great aversion to manslaughter, regarding
it as evil and sinful.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The subjects that we are now discussing are
clearly illustrated in the case of Moses. Holy man as
he was and meek and right-minded in every way, had
he known that his act of punishment was sinful like any
other slaughter, he would not have ordered it. But if
he had been so zealous in his obstinate wrath that he
had done this deed in anger rather than for the sake of
justice, God’s righteousness would surely have punished
him with a severe chastisement and stern revenge for
the great slaughter that he committed. For Moses commanded
every man who took up arms with him to spare
none, neither father nor brother nor other kinsmen, if
they had been guilty of the deed that had called God’s
anger down upon them. Moses showed a threefold righteousness
in this chastisement: for those who were with
him in the slaughter sanctified their hands in the blood
of those whom they slew, since in their deed they rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>obedience to their leader and fulfilled the sacred
laws. Those who survived regretted their sins and turned
their hearts to penitence for having broken the law,
while those who were slain were cleansed in their
penance and in the pangs which they suffered when they
died. And it was much better for them to suffer a brief
pain in death than a long torture in hell. Of the same
character are the penalties that kings impose; for a
king cleanses himself in the blood of the unjust, if he
slays them as a rightful punishment to fulfil the sacred
laws. Moreover, there are many capable men who fear
punishment alone, and would commit crimes if they
were not in terror of the king’s revenge. But one who is
to suffer punishment will confess his sins and repent of
his misdeeds; though if he did not see a sudden death
prepared for him, he would show no repentance. He is,
therefore, saved by his repentance and the pangs which
he suffers in his death. And it is better for him to suffer
a brief punishment here than endless agony and torture;
for God never punishes the same sin twice. Consequently
the king’s punishment becomes a good and
kind deed toward all those who are subject to him, for
he would rather have the one who is to be punished
suffer a brief pain here for his wickedness than to be
lost forever, in the world to come. Through this kindness
he also saves the righteous and peaceable from the
avarice and the wickedness of the violent. We may,
therefore, conclude that punishment is a good deed, if
it is exacted according to a righteous verdict; for King
Saul was deposed from his kingship because he failed
to punish according to God’s orders at the time when
he invaded the kingdoms of Amalek and the Amorites.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Now I wish to ask you why David slew the
man of whom we spoke earlier, him who brought the
tidings that Saul had fallen, and whether he slew him
justly or did it from sudden anger.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> When the man had told these tidings, David
asked how he knew them. And he said that he had lifted
up weapons against Saul at the king’s own request.
When David heard this, he spoke thus: “A wretched
creature you are, who dared to lay hands on the Lord’s
anointed; and it is better for you to suffer a swift punishment
here than to have this crime pursue you into
everlasting hell.” Thereupon David ordered him to be
slain. But when he who had hoped to receive a joyous
welcome and good gifts for his tidings, saw that death
was to be his reward, he repented that he had falsely
imputed this crime to himself and would gladly have
withdrawn his words, if he had been permitted to do
so. But David spoke thus: “Your own testimony condemns
you and not I; for you have charged yourself
with this murder of the Lord’s anointed.” We have
other and similar instances in the case of the men who
slew Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, hoping thereby to win
David’s friendship; and they fared to David with the
news that they had slain his enemy who had planned
to rise up against him and his kingship. But when David
heard these tidings he answered in this wise; “Wretches
you are for this deed, having slain your lord, though you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>were Ishbosheth’s own men; you have committed a vile
and treacherous crime in laying hands upon your lord,
and you have not acted as if you were my men and did
this out of loyalty to me. Now it will be necessary for
you to suffer a swift revenge and a prompt punishment,
lest this deed draw you into everlasting torment.” Then
David ordered his men to cut off their hands and feet
and afterwards to hang them beside a pool in a city
called Hebron.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c015'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LXIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE JUDGMENTS OF GOD ILLUSTRATED BY THE STORY OF DAVID AND SAUL</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I will venture to ask one more question about
those cases in which it seems to me that God has passed
rather strange sentences. I am asking chiefly because I
find it hard to understand what reason or circumstance
can have caused the difference in these decrees which
I now intend to bring up. You stated earlier in your
speech that God deprived Saul of his kingdom because
he was too lenient in cases of homicide, though a man
will think that this was no great offence, as it is easy
enough to slay multitudes if that be regarded a better
deed than to let them live. Still, this leniency proved
such a grievous fault that God said He regretted having
chosen Saul king over his people, and immediately
threatened—what He later carried out—that the
kingship should never be transmitted to his descendants;
and immediately, though Saul was still living, He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>appointed another to be king after his days. But after
David had become king, he committed a crime which
will scarcely seem less when reflected upon; for he committed
adultery with the wife of Uriah his knight, a
good and faithful man, and afterwards contrived his
death, not as a just penalty but because he wanted his
wife. But later, when Nathan the prophet pointed out
the sin to David and he confessed, he was forgiven at
once; indeed, it seemed as if his kingship was more
stable after that time than before. Now I do not know
which is the worse crime, to kill an innocent man and
violate his wife, or to let the guilty have their lives.
Many a man, who is ignorant as to the reason why,
may indeed imagine that God loved David more than
Saul, and that David’s crime was counted less for that
reason. But inasmuch as God always judges according
to justice and without regard to persons, it would be
sinful to hold wrong ideas about this; and it would be
well if you could add a few words in explanation, unless
you think that my questions are stupid. It may also be
that great lords who are chosen to be judges will get a
better insight into these things, if they are clearly expressed.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> This question is of such a character that it
will demand an extended answer, if it is to be fully understood.
But since it has been brought up, I shall be
glad to answer it as far as I can and as briefly as I can.
First it is necessary to recall what I said in an earlier
speech when we talked about dooms,—when they
should be severe and when lenient: I then brought out
the fact that if a good and peace-loving man should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>fall into sin and his deed should seem evil to him and
he were anxious to do penance, then the judgment ought
to be merciful in his case on account of human nature;
for human nature is so frail that no one can be so careful
as never to fall into sin. But some add to their offence
by taking pride in it, and they are not careful to avoid
falling into another sin. Now David was of all men the
most adroit in the use of weapons in warfare and he
was by nature quite severe in righteous chastisement;
but he was a kind-hearted man, friendly toward everyone,
and sympathetic toward all who suffered misfortunes.
He was also trustworthy in every respect, honest
and faithful in friendship and in all his promises, and
so virtuous that he would allow nothing vicious about
his person,—indeed his like was not found among all
the people of Israel; for when God chose David to be
king, He testified in these words, saying that He had
found a man after His own heart. But human frailty
caused him to fall in the matter that we mentioned
earlier: he violated Uriah’s wife. But after he had fallen
into this transgression and when he was once more
alone, he repented deeply, sighing and weeping. Inasmuch
as the rules of the law would condemn this crime
as a shameful reproach, if it were rumored among the
people, David planned to keep the matter quiet, letting
God see his repentance but keeping the people in ignorance
of his offence, lest they should take his misdeed
as an example and regard it as less serious to fall into
sin and transgression if they knew of his guilt. So David
sought to hide his guilt by a crafty design: for as soon
as he learned that Bathsheba, Uriah’s wife, was pregnant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>he sent for Uriah, and hoping to avoid taking his
life, he ordered him to lie with his wife so that the offspring
might be known as his, while David would atone
in secret for the sin of his whoredom and never afterward
come near Uriah’s wife. But when he found that
Uriah happened to be unwilling to lie with his wife, he
contrived to conceal his sin from men, though he increased
it in the sight of God. Later, when Nathan the
prophet charged David with all this guilt, he answered
as if condemning himself, speaking these words: “So
heavy and evil is my transgression that I am worthy
of death because of this thing; a wretch am I to have
set such an example before God’s people, over whom He
has appointed me ruler and judge; rather would I now
suffer a speedy death than have this misdeed pursue me
to hell. Now since I have set an evil example before the
people of God by my sin, I am ready to suffer punishment
according to the Lord’s will as a warning to the
people not to fall into such transgression.” But when
Truth and Justice saw David’s penitence, they permitted
Mercy to pass the judgment; for the prophet
Nathan replied in this wise: “God sees your repentance,
and He does not desire you to suffer death for your sin,
but He will punish you with an endurable chastisement
for this deed before you die.” Now you must know that
God did not forgive David’s crime so completely as to
excuse him from just punishment; for this was the first
penalty that the king suffered from God: the child which
he had begotten with Bathsheba was a man child and
very lovely, wherefore David much desired that it might
live; but it did not please God to let him enjoy the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>which he had begotten in such a sinful way. Nevertheless,
David lay seven days upon the earth in the raiment
of mourning, fasting and imploring God to let the child
live. But God would not hear his prayer, and the child
expired on the seventh day.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c015'><sup>[318]</sup></a> And this was the second
punishment, that God refused to let David build him
a temple;<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c015'><sup>[319]</sup></a> God even called him a murderer, because
he had deprived Uriah of life. But for the adultery which
he had committed with Uriah’s wife, he had to suffer
this disgrace, that his son Absalom, in the sight of all
the people, went in unto David’s concubines and thus
dishonored his father before all the people.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c015'><sup>[320]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>You have also asked which crime was the worse,
that David caused Uriah to be slain without guilt and
seduced his wife, or that Saul refused to kill so many
people of Amalek; and you shall know of a truth that
Saul’s crime was the greater; for no offence is graver
than to be disobedient toward one’s superiors, as Saul
was. And you may observe even at this day among
cloister folk, that if a monk is disobedient toward his
abbot, where an abbot rules the cloister, or toward the
prior, where such a one controls, he is forthwith expelled
from the holy order and from the monastery and
is thenceforth regarded as a layman. Likewise, if a
priest refuses to obey his superior the bishop, he is at
once deprived of clerical honors, and the right to say
mass is taken from him as well as all other official duties.
In the same way, if a bishop, be he humble or powerful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>refuses to obey his superior, he is immediately shorn of
his dignity and all his office; and after that he is regarded
among learned men as any other layman unworthy
of any distinction. And it ought to be even more
evident that it could not prosper Saul to be disobedient
to such a lord as God Himself, when he was ordered to
invade Amalek and the land of the Amorites and to slay
all that was living. God took His rod of punishment
and placed it in Saul’s hands, bidding him execute His
wrath and spare nothing that was living; to burn fortified
cities, farmsteads, clothing, and whatever else there
was; to lay the entire land in ruins and thus cleanse it
with sword and ax and fire. Saul, however, carried out
the vengeance that he was charged with in another way,
by destroying everything that was lacking in beauty or
value; but whatever seemed to him to be beautiful,
valuable, and worth possessing he spared, brought
home to his country, and distributed among his men.
But when Samuel came to Saul and showed him the
wrath of God, Saul spoke as if excusing himself: “Praise
be to God, for I have fulfilled His command: I invaded
Amalek and visited the entire kingdom with fire and
sword; but King Agag I have brought with me, wishing
to honor God’s command by slaying him here, if He
wills that he die. Fat oxen and fine sheep I have brought
hither to sacrifice such to God as are acceptable to Him;
and the children of the chief men I have brought hither
to be kept in bondage and distress, doing fitting service
for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Samuel replied: “How can God now accept
that as a sacrifice which He has Himself cursed in His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>anger? For God demands a blessed and not an accursed
sacrifice; and you shall know of a surety that obedience
is more pleasing to God than any sacrifice.” Truth
stood by and said: “What need is there to conceal the
motive that induced Saul to neglect doing as God commanded
him? Saul imagined himself so firmly established
in his kingship that he could order these things
more according to his own liking than to God’s command;
he showed excessive pride in failing to remember
who had given him the power. And this is the reason
why he took good horses, oxen, sheep, and much else of
value, that he might satisfy the greed of his knights and
the rapacity of his other warriors rather than carry out
the commands of God. And he spoke falsely when he
said that he had brought horses and sheep and other
things of value into his kingdom to sacrifice them to
God; for he knew that a cursed sacrifice was not acceptable
to God.” Then the decision was left to Justice and
she decreed in this wise: “Whereas God took His rod
of punishment, and placing it in Saul’s hands bade him
execute the divine wrath upon a cursed people, let that
punishment now come upon Saul and his family which
he failed to visit upon those whom God had commanded
him to carry it out upon. But the same rod of
punishment that was given to Saul to shake over others,
another shall now hold and shake over Saul and all his
kin. And because he wished in his avarice to possess
the riches that were forbidden him, let him now forfeit
those riches that were given to him before.”<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c015'><sup>[321]</sup></a> But the
reason why Justice passed such a severe judgment upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Saul was that God knew his disposition thoroughly.
For it was in Saul’s nature to be proud and stubborn
in the face of God; and as soon as he thought himself
firmly established in his kingdom, he became greedy
and avaricious, as is evident from this account.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now there was this difference between the tempers
of David and Saul: when Nathan the prophet charged
David with sin, he spoke reproachfully of his fault, almost
as if condemning himself, and implored mercy,
though willing to suffer punishment, as if prepared to
accept with gratitude any terms which God might impose
for his misdeed; therefore he won favor through
the lenient judgment of Mercy. Yet, his son died because
of Uriah’s death, though David himself did not
die; and for violating Uriah’s wife he suffered a great
disgrace in that his son dishonored him in the sight of
all the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when Samuel accused Saul of his crime, he replied
as if defending his cause and praised himself for
having done so well and spoke in this wise: “Praise be
to God, for I have done what He commanded;” though
he knew in his own mind that anything else was nearer
the truth. Therefore he was stricken by the sentence of
Justice, God seeing his arrogant boasting and lying excuses.
But his arrogance and envy became even more
evident after he discovered that God was angry with
him; for Saul fell ill; and now and then madness came
upon him, so that he had to be watched when the
malady troubled him. Then it was learned that if a
man could be found who could play the harp well before
him, he would find relief and the illness would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>afflict him less. So they found a lovely youth whose
name was David, the son of Jesse in Bethlehem, who
knew how to strike the harp skilfully; he came to the
king, and whenever the malady came upon Saul, David,
standing before him, struck the harp and the illness
departed immediately. But when Saul discovered that
the malady was less severe, he loved David highly and
made him his shield bearer.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c015'><sup>[322]</sup></a> Samuel, however, had already
anointed him king in secret, no one knowing it
but his father and his brothers. David remained with
Saul many days and served him faithfully; and all men
perceived that God was with him in all his doings. Saul,
too, was well disposed toward him at first: he gave him
his daughter and assigned him a troop to command.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c015'><sup>[323]</sup></a>
But after Saul had won his great victory over the Philistines
and David had slain the giant Goliath and they
were returning from the warfare, women came forth
from cities and fortresses, dancing toward them and
singing praises to them for their victory. And the burden
of their song was this, that Saul had conquered a
thousand but David ten thousand.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c015'><sup>[324]</sup></a> When Saul heard
this he was seized with wrath and envy toward David
and said in his own thoughts: “Now I perceive that God
has chosen this man to take the kingdom after me instead
of my sons; but I shall try to upset this plan if I can,
though so cleverly that no one shall perceive that I
kill him intentionally.” A few days later Saul’s habitual
illness came upon him; but David took his harp and,
standing before him, played as was his wont to relieve
the king’s illness. Saul had a javelin in his hand which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>he threw at David, aiming to drive it through him and
pin him to the wall of the room. Thus he had planned
to avoid responsibility for the murder by leading the
people to think he had done it in frenzy and not with
evil intent. David escaped and found security from
that peril. But when Saul saw that David had escaped
and he had not caught him, he sent him on frequent
forays among heathen people in the hope that he would
be slain in warfare. But the more frequently David
went out into battle, the more frequent victories and
the greater honors did he win; and God magnified him
before the eyes of all the people. And the more Saul saw
him prosper, the more he envied him.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c015'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Now you can imagine the state of King Saul’s mind:
he could say nothing against David, only what was
good. But since he perceived that God loved David
much because of his humility and loyalty, he envied
him as Cain envied his brother Abel because God loved
him. Indeed, Saul’s enmity toward David became so
evident that he could not conceal his intentions to kill
him. Then Jonathan, Saul’s son, reminded the king
that it would be a sin to slay an innocent man, speaking
in this wise: “My lord, why are you angry with your
servant David? If there is any guilt on his part that
may be injurious to your kingdom or dignity, every
man who is with you here will seek his life; and we can
seize him whenever we like, for he is not on his guard
against us, knowing himself to be guiltless. He has
served you long and has been faithful in all things; he
fought against great odds when he slew Goliath, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>God rescued your entire kingdom through David’s wonderful
victory, which he won fighting unarmed against
a giant. He has waited upon you in your distressing illness;
and wherever you have placed him at the head of
the host, he has brought a vigorous defense to your
kingdom, and no one knows that he has been anything
but loyal. Therefore conquer your wrath, sire, and do
not fall into such an evident sin of murder before God
as to slay an innocent man.”<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c015'><sup>[326]</sup></a> Saul, however, became
only the more wrathful and charged with treason his
son and everyone else who spoke a good word for
David.</p>

<p class='c010'>David fled from King Saul’s wrath with a few men,
but provided with neither clothes nor weapons. He
came to the city called Nob, the bishop of which was
Ahimelech, a son of Ahitub the bishop; but Ahitub was
the son of Ichabod, the son of Phineas, the son of Eli
the bishop. When David came to the bishop Ahimelech,
he pretended to be traveling on an important mission
for King Saul, and asked him to give him and his men
something to eat and to furnish him with weapons. The
bishop Ahimelech gave him such victuals as he had, but
weapons he had none to give him except the sword that
had belonged to Goliath; and this he gave him, for he
did not know that he was a fugitive, but believed he
was traveling on the king’s errand, as he had said. But
so fierce was Saul’s hatred toward David, that as soon
as he learned that the bishop Ahimelech had given him
food, he seized the bishop and all his kinsmen and
charged them with treason. The bishop replied to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>charge in this wise: “My lord, I confess that I gave
David what food I had and the weapon that I had, for
he said he was traveling on an important errand on
your behalf. Why should I not give hospitality to a
man like David, who is the best and the most highly
esteemed of all the men that you have about you except
your sons, and who is furthermore your own son-in-law
and has been faithful to you in all things? Never
have I had any design against you or your honor. Do
not think, my lord, that I, your servant, have plotted
with David against your will; I could not know why
David traveled in such distress, for he told me that
you had sent him with important errands; nor did I
know that he had fallen into any guilt against you.”
Then Saul replied in fierce anger: “This I swear that
you shall perish to-day, you and all your kin.” Thereupon
he caused the bishop to be slain along with eighty-five
other men, all of whom were robed in the priestly
dignity. After that he ordered all who dwelt in the city
of Nob to be slain, even women and children, and had
the city burned.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c015'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Now I have revealed to you the ferocity which God
found in Saul’s heart when he removed him from the
kingship, and which later became evident in what you
have now heard and in much else of like import, though
I have told this only. The displeasure which the king
incurred from God fell so heavily upon him, for the
reason that God saw in his heart the fierce avarice which
later began to appear. Now he wanted to kill David,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>though innocent, because he found that God loved him;
and he slew the bishop, though guiltless, and so fierce
was he that he slew everything in the city that had life
and afterward burned the city. But where God had
commanded him to use severity of this sort, there he
had spared; here, however, he slew God’s servants in
defiance of God’s command. But in David’s case God
passed a more lenient judgment for the reason that,
just as he perceived the ferocity in Saul’s heart, he
found true repentance and clemency in David’s heart,
as I shall now show you.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a son of the bishop Ahimelech, Abiathar
by name, who was hid in a cave when all those were
slain of whom I have just spoken. Abiathar fled to
David and told him all these happenings. But when
David heard these tidings, he sighed and spoke thus
in deep sorrow: “May God in His mercy forgive me
for this slaughter, for I have too great a share in it,
having eaten your father’s bread. And now since you
have come hither, abide with me; and if God permits
me to live, He will also protect you with me, and let
whatever God wishes happen to us both.” Thereupon
David elevated him to the bishop’s office which his
father had held. But when David’s kinsmen learned
that he was abiding in the forest, they joined him with
a large force counting not fewer than four hundred men;
and from that time on David grew in strength as God
willed.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c015'><sup>[328]</sup></a> He camped among the hills with this force and
made repeated attacks on Saul’s enemies, but never on
the king himself or his men. But whenever Saul learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>where David lay concealed, he marched out to seek him,
intending to slay him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then it happened once, when David and his men
were hiding in a large cave, that Saul entered this alone
on a necessary errand. Then said David’s companions:
“Now God has fulfilled what He has promised you and
has delivered your enemy into your hands; be sure to
secure this quarry.” David stole up and cut a piece off
Saul’s mantle, though the king was not aware of it, and
returned to his comrades. Then David’s companions
said to him: “If you are unwilling to lay your own hand
upon him, let us kill him.” David replied: “My crime
would be as great before God, whether I do it myself
or bid others do it. God keep me and all our companions
from such a sin as to lay hands upon the Lord’s
anointed. He is my master and I served him long; he
is also the Lord’s anointed and it would be a great
crime, if I were to lay hands upon him, for I have no
revenge to take either for father or brother or any other
kinsman; nor is it as if he had taken the throne which
he sits upon from my kinsmen with violence or deceit;
but God chose him to it and sanctified him to His service,
honoring him with His own name. Wherefore it is
right that He Who appointed him to the kingship
should deprive him of it according to His will, but not
I in vengeful audacity. And I swear this day that God
alone shall call him, whether by demanding his soul or
by causing him to fall in battle before his enemies; but
as for my hands, they shall let him live many days. But
I regret deeply that I injured his garment if he shall
feel hurt or dishonored because of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>When Saul had departed and returned to his host,
David ran up on a hill and cried: “My lord, King Saul!
can you hear?” But when Saul turned to hear what this
man said, David bent both knees to the earth and bowing
before the king said to him: “Those men do ill who
tell you, my lord, that I mean to be your enemy; for
now I have evidence here in my hand that your life was
in my power to-day, when you left all your host and entered
the cave alone; and it was no less in my power to
injure your life than your clothes, for here I have in my
hand a large piece of the skirt of your mantle. Now let
God judge between us. You see how they have told
lying tales, who say that I have striven after your life.”
Saul appreciated these facts fully, for David spoke the
truth; and he promised that he would nevermore hate
David.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c015'><sup>[329]</sup></a> But not many days passed before Saul went
out again to seek David, as he did constantly after that.
Now it came to pass another time, when Saul had made
a wearisome journey in search of David, that sleep came
upon the king and all his host. And David went into
the camp where Saul lay, but none was aware of it.
The man who accompanied him was named Abishai
and he said to David: “Now you can see that God
surely intends to deliver your enemy into your hands,
and it is not advisable to refuse what God Himself offers
you. I will thrust my spear through him, if you will
permit me, and then we shall return to our men.” David
answered: “God has done this to tempt me and to see
whether I would lay my hands on His anointed. Now I
must answer as before, that God shall tear the kingship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>from him, either by demanding his soul or by causing
him to fall before his enemies; but as for my hands, they
shall let him live many days; for I have no revenge to
cherish against him, either for plunder or for the loss of
kinsmen, except such as was incurred while he was
cleansing the land with righteous punishment; and it
is neither my proper business nor that of anyone else
to take revenge for such; for it is a more serious matter
than even a wise man can conceive to lay hands on the
Lord’s anointed, who is dedicated and hallowed to God.
Let us take his saddle-cup and his spear for a proof, and
then let us return to our forces.”<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c015'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Now you will understand the character of both King
Saul and David from what I have just told you. David
knew that he was chosen of God to govern, that he was
the Lord’s anointed, consecrated and hallowed to God
no less than Saul was. He also knew that God had rejected
Saul. And God delivered Saul into David’s hands,
so that he could have taken Saul’s life at any time, if
he had wished. David showed great faithfulness and
humility in this, that every time he saw Saul, he bowed
before him and saluted him as any other unhallowed
layman would, who had not been set apart for chieftainship.
Although Saul lay in wait for his life, David continued
to serve him, and worried the king’s enemies as
much as he could. On the other hand, Saul had nothing
against David except that he knew God had chosen
him to be king; and he showed great wickedness and
fierce hatred in striving to slay an innocent man, one
who served him faithfully. He likewise displayed an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>inordinate vanity in wishing to make away with a man
whom God Himself had chosen to rule after him. For
these reasons God passed a severe judgment in Saul’s
case; for He saw in Saul’s heart what men could not
perceive, though subsequently God made this fact evident
to the sight of men. But in David’s case God was
more lenient, for the reason that He found him always
humble and faithful in everything, as He made clear to
men later on. There is further evidence of this in the
fact, that as soon as David learned that Saul and his
son Jonathan had fallen, he and all his host lamented
in great sorrow, and David spoke these words: “Be ye
cursed, ye mountains of Gilboa! May God nevermore
send rain or dew or growing grass upon you, for you
led King Saul and his son Jonathan along treacherous
paths in their flight across your summits and refused
to show them serviceable highways, whereby they could
save their lives from the hands of the foeman; nor did
you provide them with sheltering ramparts upon your
heights. It is a bitter sorrow for all the people of Israel,
that splendid chieftains like Saul and Jonathan should
pass away from council and government. Great strength
and power have perished this day, when such excellent
princes are fallen as Saul and Jonathan were, and the
many good knights with many good weapons and much
good armor who have perished with them. Let the lesser
men beware of God’s wrath, since He has allowed the
heathen to lay hands on His anointed. Let the multitude
bewail a loss like this, that such excellent rulers
should fall before the heathen.”<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c015'><sup>[331]</sup></a> Such words and many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>more like them David spoke that day, and thus he
lamented their death rather than rejoiced in the fact
that the realm had fallen to him and into his keeping.
From this you will observe how upright he was, how
honest and free from faults. But whenever human nature
caused him to fall into sin, he forthwith showed
keen repentance, imploring God’s mercy and compassion;
and God gave heed at once to his honest regret.</p>

<p class='c010'>Earlier in our conversation we have told how Absalom,
King David’s son, raised the whole land in revolt
against his father. But when David’s captains
happened to meet Absalom in battle and David learned
of his death, he cried out in these words: “What shall
it profit me to live, an aged man who grows weaker day
by day, now that you, my son Absalom, are dead in the
flowertime of youth? Would to God that I could die
now and that you my son might live!”<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c015'><sup>[332]</sup></a> David was
never so bitter against other men but that he would
rather suffer death himself than see another’s death,
except where he saw that punishment was inflicted on
the demand of justice. This was shown again at one
time when David’s entire kingdom incurred the wrath
of God, and a pestilence came upon the realm, so violent
that people perished by thousands. When the plague
approached the city of Jerusalem, David beheld the
angel, who was smiting the people, standing between
heaven and earth with a blazing sword. And when he
saw the angel with the sword lifted as if ready to strike,
he placed his neck under the edge and said: “I beg
thee, O Lord, that this sword be rather turned against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>my neck than that more of God’s people shall now be
slain, and that my Lord’s wrath may fall upon me, who
am guilty and worthy of punishment, and upon my
family rather than that God’s people shall be rooted
out on my account.” As soon as God saw David’s regret
and heard his very acceptable prayer, He commanded
the angel to desist from slaying the people, and forthwith
the plague ceased everywhere in the kingdom.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c015'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>From these and many other similar instances you
will now observe how full of grace and goodness David
was toward all men. And just as God saw kindliness,
mercy, and humility in his heart, He saw avarice, ferocity,
and unmeasured pride in Saul’s heart; consequently
every fault was graver before God in Saul’s case than
in David’s; for the men were unlike. David was the
meekest and the most merciful of men, and whenever
he fell into any fault he implored God to spare him; but
Saul grew fiercer and more envious the more sins he fell
into and the nearer he saw God’s wrath approaching.
Now if you think that these answers have led you to
a clearer understanding of the matters that you have
asked about, I believe it will not be necessary to discuss
these subjects any further.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE JUDGMENTS OF SOLOMON</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I see clearly now from what you told in your
last speech that the judgments were lenient in David’s
case, because he regretted the sins into which he fell,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>but more severe in Saul’s case, because he was less disposed
to do penance for his misdeeds. Now there are
certain other matters which I am much interested in
and which I shall ask about with your permission,
namely those events that occurred after David’s death.
Once when two women came before King Solomon,
quarreling about a child, the king ordered the child to
be hewn in pieces and half given to each of them:<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c015'><sup>[334]</sup></a> now
I wish to ask whether, if neither of the women had
spoken up, the king would have hewn the child asunder
or not.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The king ordered the child to be divided because
he knew of a surety that the one who was the
mother would not be willing to have the child divided.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> I asked whether the king would have divided
the child if the mother had kept silence.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> If the mother had been so void of mercy that
she would not ask him to spare the child, the king would
have divided it between them.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Son.</i> Would it not look to you like plain murder, if
he had slain an innocent child, seeing that it was not for
punishment?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> It would indeed have been murder if he had
killed the child; still, the guilt would not have been with
the king but with the mother, if she had failed to beg
mercy for her child, when she heard the king render a
fair judgment in their case, which she realized would
mean the child’s death; therefore the guilt would be
hers if she withheld the motherly pity which could save
the child.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span><i>Son.</i> What do you think about the death of Joab and
Adonijah, whom King Solomon slew? Was that a righteous
judgment or not? And why did King Solomon
cause Shimei to be slain for cursing his father David,
seeing that David had already forgiven Shimei this
offence?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> If King Solomon had done this except as lawful
punishment, God would have visited him with a
worthy penalty as for murder. But after he had done
all this, God revealed Himself to him in a dream and
bade him choose whatever gift he might wish. But Solomon
asked God to give him wisdom and insight into
righteous judgments. Then God answered him in this
wise: “If this choice were given to the multitude, there
would be many who would choose riches and power, or
a long life, or peace, or success in warfare. But because
thou hast chosen this thing, thou shalt receive what thou
hast chosen and likewise all the other gifts that I have
enumerated.” From this you will observe how well God
is pleased with righteousness in judgments; for God
gave Solomon all the supreme gifts, because he chose
equity as his part. And you will understand that, if he
had slain those others unjustly, God would not have
given him such excellent gifts as He did give him.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c006' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SOLOMON’S DECISION IN THE CASE OF SHIMEI</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> What you have just said does indeed seem reasonable.
If Solomon had been led to execute these men
through selfishness and injustice, he would not have
received such excellent gifts from God, as were given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>to him after that deed was done. Still, if I may, I should
like to ask you to point out how righteous dooms are
worked out, in order that I may understand more
clearly, and others too who may hear it, how Solomon
could execute Shimei by righteous decree, when his
father David had already forgiven him the offence.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c015'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Solomon did this out of regard for justice
rather than from cruelty, and for the following reasons.
When Shimei cursed David, he did it out of impudence
and malice, and for no just cause; but when he begged
David for mercy, he asked it more because of fear than
of repentance, for he was afraid that David would take
his life as the sacred law demanded. But when he implored
mercy David replied in these words: “I shall
not slay you this time, since you implore my grace; but
keep in mind that you will be punished for this deed,
unless you atone in true repentance.” In these words
David pointed out to Shimei that he ought to atone
with loving friendship for the words that he had spoken
in sheer hatred. Shimei, however, lived the rest of his
days in such a manner that, while no one found him
to cherish enmity toward David, it never appeared that
he made returns in friendship for David’s mercy in permitting
him to live when the law demanded his death.
But when he came before Solomon after David’s death,
the king said to him: “Remember, Shimei, that you
cursed the Lord’s anointed; and it has not appeared
that you have truly regretted it since. But this shall be
a covenant between us as a reminder to repentance on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>your part, that you shall not enjoy such complete freedom
as one who has never fallen into this sin. Now you
have large and beautiful dwellings and many houses
here in Jerusalem and you may live in peace within the
city, enjoying all your possessions according to your
desire; but if you ever go outside the city, the punishment
of the law shall come upon your head, since you
did not take thought to repent before I reminded you.”
When the king had ceased speaking, Shimei expressed
himself as thankful for this agreement and said that he
should find but little inconvenience in being forbidden
to leave the city, if he might remain secure in the king’s
friendship within the city and enjoy all his possessions.
Three years later, however, Shimei forgot this agreement
and went outside the city to seek diversion,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c015'><sup>[336]</sup></a> as if
proud of his audacity in violating the covenant. But as
soon as these tidings were told to the king, he ordered
Shimei to be seized and brought before him, and he said
to him: “You have forgotten to be ashamed of having
broken the agreement which we two made as a reminder
that you owe repentance for having cursed the Lord’s
anointed. There is, therefore, a double guilt upon your
head now; and it will be better for you to suffer a brief
punishment here, so that others may be warned by your
misfortune, than that this crime should follow you into
eternal death, and others become bolder in such evil, if
you die unpunished.” Then the king ordered him to be
killed and buried outside the city as a reminder and
warning to others never to break a covenant.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>LXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SOLOMON’S JUDGMENT IN THE CASE OF ADONIJAH AND HIS FOLLOWERS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Now I wish to ask you why Solomon caused his
brother Adonijah to be put to death for requesting
Abishag to be his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> Adonijah had earlier, as you may have heard,
led an uprising against his father. When David had become
an aged man and was very decrepit because of his
many years, Adonijah appointed himself to be king
without his father’s knowledge, and made a festive
banquet as newly consecrated king. He sent heralds
running through the streets with pipes and drums to
proclaim throughout the city that Adonijah was now
the king. The chief men who were with him in this
plot were Joab, David’s chief captain and his kinsman,
and Abiathar the bishop, and many other lords. But
when Zadoc the bishop, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah
the captain, and Bathsheba the queen came as if in
deep sorrow to tell David what great undertakings
were hidden from him, he remained silent for some time
but sighed heavily. At last he spoke as from a heart full
of grief and said: “My sons are not minded like me,
for I served King Saul many days, though he sought
after my life. And yet God had chosen me to be king,
for He was angry with King Saul; but I awaited the
judgment of God by which he would be deprived of
his kingdom; but I would not condemn him, though he
was mine adversary. Now my son has done that to me
which I would not do to mine enemy. But because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>Adonijah has taken the kingship to which God Himself
appointed me, even before I had renounced it or He
Who had chosen me had removed me, he shall fall in
disgrace from this dignity, as that one fell who in
arrogant pride raised the first rebellion against his
Lord.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then David said to Zadoc the bishop: “Take my
mule and harness him with all the accoutrements with
which he was arrayed when I rode him in all my glory
and set my son Solomon upon him; and taking Nathan
the prophet with you and Benaiah the captain and all
my most loyal chiefs and knights, ride to the tabernacle
of the Lord in Zion<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c015'><sup>[337]</sup></a> and there anoint my son Solomon
king. Then take my own trumpet and let it be sounded
throughout the city with a festive sound to proclaim
that Solomon is king by the will of God and David’s
choice. After that you shall bring my son Solomon to
me that I may welcome the newly appointed king to my
throne.” When David had ceased speaking, Zadoc the
bishop did all those things that the king had commanded.
And when Solomon returned arrayed in all
the tokens of royalty, David rose to receive him, bowed
before him, and blessed him in these words: “Praise be
to Thee, O God, that Thou wert pleased to exalt me
from my low estate to such high honors as I now enjoy,
and hast helped me in many perils, and now after much
trouble and long toil hast brought me the consolation
that mine eyes should behold the one sprung from my
loins whom Thou hast Thyself chosen to sit in the seat
of honor to which Thou didst formerly appoint me, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>to Thy promises, O Lord. Now I pray Thee, O
Lord, give this young man David’s glory and understanding
in double and threefold measure, make him a
perfect ruler to govern Thy holy people according to
Thy will.” Then David kissed Solomon and said to him:
“The God Who rules the heavens multiply peace to
you above all the kings upon earth and give you blessings
and the fruits of earth and perfect happiness.”<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c015'><sup>[338]</sup></a>
When he had ended this speech and benediction, David
said to Solomon: “Because I find that God has given
you wisdom and understanding, I charge you to govern
wisely and justly, though somewhat severely, lest the
kingdom should seem to be lacking in government because
of your faint-heartedness. But temper the severity
of punishment, lest you be thought too stern and merciless.
Remember your kinsman Joab, however, who has
served me long and with much labor; but it is not fitting
that the sinful deeds which he has committed should
follow him to hell: for he slew two excellent captains
who were in my peace, Abner and Amasa, who had
served King Saul with great fidelity. And there are
many others whom he slew in his overweening pride,
but not in lawful chastisement. And it is better to let
him suffer a brief punishment here than that he should
be lost eternally because of these crimes. Keep also my
promise to Shimei, though he cursed me when I fled
from the violence of your brother Absalom; but keep
it in such a way that he will be reminded to do penance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>for his misdeeds, lest the curse be forever upon his head
which he incurred when he cursed me an innocent man.
Let kinship temper your wrath against your brother
Adonijah, if you see that he regrets his treasonable uprising
against his father. Remember that the bishop
Abiathar lost his father and all his kinsmen, because he
gave me food, when I came to Nob a fugitive from the
face of King Saul. Abiathar deserves well for this, too,
that he followed me and bore the ark of God before me,
when I fled from the face of your brother Absalom. But
do not forget to give him a reminder to repentance for
joining your brother Adonijah in treasonable designs
against me, lest this offence should follow him to his
death. Be manly, strong, and severe, but with moderation.
Do the will of God in all things, and both temporal
and eternal joys shall be added to you.”<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c015'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Then said David to Zadoc the bishop and Nathan
the prophet: “Go now and prepare a banquet and
lead King Solomon into my hall and let him sit in my
high-seat amid festive joys.” And they did everything
as David bade them. But when Adonijah’s feast was
ended, the guests heard singing and piping and all forms
of merriment, as if a new joy had come into the city.
When Adonijah asked what the merry-making signified,
whether the rejoicing was in his honor or new
tidings had come, it was told him that David had himself
given Solomon his title and all the royal honors and
had chosen him to be king; and that Solomon was already
hallowed as king and sitting upon David’s throne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>in festive raiment; and that all the people rejoiced in
the news as on a merry holiday. When Adonijah heard
this report, great terror came upon him and all those
who were with him in this conspiracy, and they fled
every man to his house. But Adonijah fled to the tabernacle
of the Lord and laid his hand upon the sacred
altar, as if taking vows of chastity and service in God’s
holy tabernacle. Thereupon he sent a man to the king,
saying: “Here shall I die, unless my lord King Solomon
will promise and assure me that he will not slay me, his
servant, for the evil that I have done.” Then King
Solomon replied: “Adonijah is my brother by kinship;
therefore I will gladly spare him, if he will show true
repentance for stirring up treason and rebellion against
his father David; and I will bear this burden with him
before God on the condition that he must always continue
loyal, humble, and free from deceit. But if any
treasonable ambitions be found in him, he may expect
a swift revenge to come upon his head. Let him now go
home to his possessions and enjoy them as long as he
keeps what is now decreed.”<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c015'><sup>[340]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>When the hour of David’s death was approaching,
Solomon frequently visited his father; and when the
king had departed this life, he mourned for him many
days, he and all the lords in the kingdom; and he buried
him with every form of royal pomp and at a vast outlay.
But after David’s death, Adonijah begged Bathsheba
the queen to ask King Solomon to give him
Abishag to wife. The facts respecting Abishag were
these: when King David grew old, chills entered into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>his flesh, so that clothes were not sufficient to keep him
warm; Abishag was a young virgin, the fairest maid in
the kingdom and of the best and noblest family; she
was brought to King David’s bed to lie close to him
and warm him and cherish him, in the hope that the
king might draw warmth from her soft and blossoming
form and from his desire for the fair virgin. David loved
her highly with a perfect affection, but as a foster-mother,
not as a wife. And for this reason Abishag won
such great honor that she came to be regarded as the
first queen and she ranked above all the other queens
in the eyes of the people; and thus her dignity was sanctified
by David’s embraces. But Adonijah had a purpose
in seeking this marriage after David’s decease, for he
hoped in this way to obtain the kingship by deceitful
intrigue; inasmuch as all the people would say, if he
married Abishag, that he was most worthy to sit on
David’s throne who was most worthy to mount his bed
and lie in the arms which David had hallowed with his
very self. He also presumed, as seemed reasonable, that
the brothers and all the kinsmen of Abishag would
rather have him as king, if she were his, than a man
who was not bound to them in this way. Queen Bathsheba
undertook Adonijah’s errand and afterwards went
to seek an interview with her son King Solomon. As soon
as she had entered the royal hall, the king rose to meet
his mother and led her to a seat at his side. Then the
queen revealed her errand, speaking thus: “I have a
little favor to ask of you, but I will not reveal the request
before you promise to grant it.” The king replied: “You
are my mother, and I cannot refuse what you wish to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>ask; and I surely intend that you shall have what you
have come to ask for. But it surely behooves you to
keep in mind that you should ask only for what I may
freely grant.” Then said Bathsheba the queen to the
king: “I have come to ask you to give your brother
Adonijah Abishag to wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then King Solomon replied in great wrath: “What
is at the bottom of this request that Abishag be given
to Adonijah? If you prefer that he should have the
kingship rather than I, then ask the kingdom for him;
for you know that my brother Adonijah is older than I
and once assumed the royal title, being chosen by the
chief lords before my father had appointed me to be
ruler in obedience to the will of God. Joab the most
powerful of the lords and captains and Abiathar the
bishop have evidently continued plotting with him even
to this day. Abishag is of the noblest kinship in the city
and the whole realm; furthermore, she is honored by all
as the first queen because of the care that she gave my
father in his old age. If she is given to Adonijah to be
his wife, the people will regard him as most worthy to
sit in David’s seat, since he is thought worthy to lie in
the bed and in the arms in which David himself lay.
Now when Adonijah had committed treason against his
father, I offered to share the responsibility for his sin
before God because of our kinship. But now he has repeated
and trebled the treason against me, his brother,
which he first committed against his father. Therefore
I swear by the God Who has placed me on David’s
throne that Adonijah shall suffer for his guilt, as shall
every one of the others who are with him in this traitorous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>project.” Then King Solomon said to Benaiah the
captain: “Go and slay my brother Adonijah, for I would
rather have him suffer a swift penalty here, such as the
rules of the holy law provide for treason against one’s
lord, than to have him carry a traitor’s guilt to hell.
Slay also Joab my kinsman, for twice he committed vile
offences against King David, when he slew Abner and
Amasa, two renowned captains, though they were in
David’s peace and protection. But his third and greatest
crime is this, that he was traitor to David when he gave
Adonijah the royal title; surely he will be lost forever in
the world to come, unless he shall do penance in this
world by suffering a lawful punishment.”<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c015'><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In this case King Solomon gives clear proof that it is
quite permissible to break vows and promises, if what
has been asked or granted is contrary to what is right.
He granted what his mother Bathsheba the queen had
come to request before he knew what it was; but as soon
as he was aware that the prayer was a perilous one, he
slew the man who had originally made the request.
Benaiah did as King Solomon commanded and slew
Adonijah. But just as Joab the captain and Abiathar
the bishop had shared in the plans to give Adonijah the
royal title, they also had a share in his plan to ask for
Abishag to wife; and when they heard of Adonijah’s
death, they foresaw their own destruction. Benaiah
seized Abiathar the bishop and led him before King
Solomon; but Joab fled to God’s tabernacle and laid his
hand upon the sacred horn of the altar, as if taking vows
of chastity and service in God’s holy tabernacle. Benaiah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>came to God’s sanctuary and said: “Come forth, Joab,
the king commands you to come forth out of God’s
tabernacle.” But Joab replied: “I have come hither
into God’s protection, and I will suffer death here, if I
cannot remain in security.” Then Benaiah reported his
answer to the king through his messenger; and when the
messenger came before the king bringing the bishop
Abiathar and related all these things, King Solomon
said to him: “Give my command to Benaiah to slay
Joab wherever he be found, for his deeds and the decrees
of the sacred law slay him and not we.” Benaiah
did as King Solomon commanded and slew Joab where
he then stood.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c015'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>But the king spoke in this wise to the bishop Abiathar:
“You know that you have deserved death according
to the rules of the holy law; but whereas you lost
your father and all your kinsmen in Nob in a single day,
because your father had given my father David food,
and whereas you also bore the ark of God before my
father when he fled before the face of my brother Absalom,
therefore it is right that for once you should
profit from this and not suffer a sudden death. And for
this once you shall purchase your life on the following
terms, which you must keep as a constant reminder
that you owe penance for the treason which you committed
against David: go now to your own fields and
abide there as a husbandman and enjoy all your possessions,
on the condition, however, that you remain a
tiller of the soil. But if you ever stretch forth your hand
to perform any priestly service or office, the righteous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>penalty of the sacred law shall surely come upon your
head.”<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c015'><sup>[343]</sup></a> Abiathar went home and did as the king commanded
and lived many days; but Shimei died three
years later, because he failed to keep what had been
commanded, as we have already told.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>LXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>WHY SOLOMON BROKE HIS PROMISE OF PEACE<br /> AND SECURITY TO JOAB</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> There are still a few points which, it seems to
me, I have not examined sufficiently. How did it occur
to Solomon to break peace with Joab, seeing that he
had fled into God’s protection and into the house, the
only one in all the world, that was dedicated to God?
Churches have now been built in almost every part of
the world, and it is considered an evil deed to slay a man
who has sought sanctuary. But I have thought that the
honor of God’s holy house would be the more zealously
guarded the fewer such houses were. Another matter
which I wish to ask about is this: how did it occur to
Solomon to promise what his mother might request and
then to break his promise? I should have thought that
a wise man like Solomon would have ascertained what
the request was likely to be before he gave his promise,
and thus avoid recalling his promise, if the request were
not to his liking.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I stated in an earlier speech that he who
makes a request should be discreet and ask such things
only as are proper and may be freely granted; and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>those favors that are wisely asked and granted in like
manner ought to remain valid and undisturbed. But
Solomon set a good and profitable example in this case,
when he wisely withdrew the gift that his mother had
indiscreetly requested, though he had already granted
it. The following example which is evil and belongs to
a much later date was set by Herod: once when he was
feasting in Galilee he promised to give his step-daughter
whatever she might ask; and on her mother’s advice she
demanded the head of John the Baptist.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c015'><sup>[344]</sup></a> Herod knew
that John was an innocent and holy man and deeply
regretted that he had made this promise. But his repentance
bore no fruit, inasmuch as he was not careful
to withdraw the gift wisely which she had requested
foolishly; nay more, he did the evil deed that she had
suggested. Consequently all were destroyed, the women
because of their request and Herod because of his gift.
King Solomon, however, thought it better to face his
mother’s wrathful temper for refusing wisely what he
had promised hastily, than to suffer the injury that
follows the great crime of allowing foolish and sinful
petitions. On the other hand, you should understand
clearly that it is never proper for a man to be fickle in
promises, and the greater the man, the less fitting it is.
But no man is allowed to grant anything that may
give rise to crime and sin, even though he has already
promised to do so.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>LXVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A DISCUSSION OF PROMISES: WHEN THEY MUST BE KEPT<br /> AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Now I wish to ask you to tell me somewhat more
clearly how far one should keep what he has pledged
and how far he may refuse to carry out what he has
promised.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> When a lord is asked to grant a favor and
the meaning of the request is made clear to him, he
ought to ponder carefully what it is that he is asked to
do and whether it will bring him injury or honor. If he
sees that he can grant it without damage to himself, he
ought next to consider the person to whom he is to give
what has been asked, and how much may be given in
each case, lest he should have an experience like that of
Herod, which has already been related. For Herod did
not consider fully the merits of the one who made the
request, or the occasion, or how much he ought to give.
There was this difficulty, too, in Herod’s case, that he
was drunk when he made the promise; he had made a
great banquet for all his lords, and he failed to consider
the occasion; for it was not proper for him to make gifts
while drunk, since one who is drunk will rarely be moderate
in making gifts. He also failed to observe moderation
in this, that he gave such an unusual gift to his
step-daughter, a woman who was not of his kin, for he
spoke in these terms: “Whatsoever you ask I will give
you, though you ask half of my kingdom.” You will
observe from this that he was half-mad from drink when
he spoke, for his step-daughter had honored him merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>by beating the drum before him, and her music was entitled
to a much smaller reward than the one promised.
Nor was it fitting for him to leave the form of the request
as well as of the gift to the tongues of others, as
he did when he spoke as follows: “Whatsoever you ask
you shall have, though you ask half of my kingdom.”
But if he had spoken in this wise: “Whatever you ask
with discretion and in moderation you shall receive, if
I can give it,” then he would have spoken wisely and
well, and it would have remained with him whether to
grant or to refuse.</p>

<p class='c010'>It now remains to point out what sort of gifts a ruler
may properly give, when he is asked to do so. Any request
may be granted which will bring honor and help
to him who asks and will bring no damage to the lord
who gives or to any one else. Thus if a lord is asked to
give assistance or money, he may well give it, unless
his honor should be discredited by the gift; and he may
properly give both the labor and the money so long as
he gives them to such as are worthy of great honors.
But when one is asked to grant a request that would
debase or dishonor him, he must refuse it; and even
though he should make a promise thoughtlessly, it is
to be wisely withdrawn. And if a man bestows a generous
gift on one who shows little appreciation of it and
is in no wise worthy to have a long and continued possession
of an important gift, inasmuch as he does not
show proper appreciation, this gift, too, should be withdrawn;
for in this case the man’s own thoughtlessness
and lack of discernment take the gift from him and not
the fickleness of him who gave. And if one who desired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>a gift has obtained it through falsehood and deceitful
pretence, that gift is also to be withdrawn, even though
it has been granted; and in this case the man’s own fraud
and deceit take the gift from him and not the fickleness
of him who promised and gave it. But a prince who
means to be cautious in making gifts must consider
carefully what is requested, and what sort of man has
made the request. And since all do not deserve equally
great gifts, one must consider how great a gift each
one deserves and on what occasion a gift may be given.
Then it shall be said but very seldom that he who gave
has withdrawn his gift or that he has been found to be
fickle-minded.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>CONCERNING THE KINGSHIP AND THE CHURCH AND<br /> THE KING’S RESPONSIBILITY TO GOD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> Now I wish to ask what good reasons there are
which would justify King Solomon’s act in causing Joab
to be slain in God’s holy tabernacle while he was clinging
to God’s sacred altar. Why did he not order him to
be brought away first and slain afterwards?</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> The matter about which you have now inquired
cannot be made clear without a lengthy explanation,
which will seem more like a comment than a
proper continuation of the conversation in which we
are now engaged. When Solomon concluded that it was
better to slay Joab where he then was than to bring
him away, he was not without good grounds for his
decision; for he did not wish to fall into such a sin as
King Saul fell into when he brought sacrifices to God’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>holy altar. Now Solomon did not wish to make this a
pretext that he intended to bring gifts or sacrifices to
God’s holy altar, as if he were carrying out episcopal
functions; nor did he wish to take away by force or
violence anything that had come so near God’s holy
altar as Joab then was, inasmuch as he was clinging to
the sacred altar. But Solomon pondered the whole matter
in his own mind: “It is my duty to carry out the
provisions of the sacred law, no matter where the man
happens to be whose case is to be determined; but it is
not my duty to remove a man by force or violence who
has fled to the holy place; for all just decisions are in
truth God’s decisions and not mine. And I know of a
surety that God’s holy altar will not be defiled or desecrated
by Joab’s blood, for it will be shed in righteous
punishment and as a penance for him, but not in hatred
as in the case of an unjust verdict.” In this decision
King Solomon illustrated the division of duties that
God made between Moses and Aaron; and he did not
wish to disturb this arrangement, lest he should fall
into disfavor with God. For God had marked out their
duties in such a way that Moses was to watch over the
rules of the holy law, while Aaron was to care for the
sacrifices that might come to the sacred altar.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c015'><sup>[345]</sup></a> And
you shall know of a truth that this arrangement ought
by right to stand even at this day; and you may be
able to see this more clearly, if I add a few words in
explanation. For the reason is this, that God has established
two houses upon earth, each chosen for a definite
service. The one is the church; in fact we may give this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>name to both, if we like, for the word church means
the same as judgment hall, because there the people
meet and assemble. These two houses are the halls of
God, and He has appointed two men to keep watch
over them. In one of these halls He has placed His
table, and this is called the house of bread; for there
God’s people gather to receive spiritual food. But in the
other hall He has placed His holy judgment seat; and
there the people assemble to hear the interpretation
of God’s holy verdicts. And God has appointed two
keepers to guard these houses: the one is the king, the
other the bishop.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now the king is appointed to keep watch over the
sacred house in which the holy seat is placed and to
keep the holy verdicts of God. In temporal matters he
is to judge between men and in such a way that the
reward of eternal salvation may be given to him and to
all others who after his day uphold the decisions that
have been justly rendered. Into his hands God has also
committed the sword of punishment with which to
strike when the need arises, just as King Solomon did
when he laid Joab under the sword of chastisement,
with many others whom he subjected to righteous penalties,
as we have already told. The king, then, must
always strike, not in hatred but for righteous punishment.
But if he slay any one out of hatred, it is murder,
and he will have to answer for it as murder before God.
You shall also know of a truth that no one is allowed to
pluck away any of those things that God from the beginning
has assigned to His hall and high-seat; for that
would be to rob God Himself and His holy judgment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>seat and to disturb arrogantly the arrangement which
God has made. And every one who is assigned to this
seat should ponder in deep thought what plea he shall
have to present when he comes before his own Judge;
for every man who comes in his turn before the Highest
Judge, having been steward in His hall, may confidently
expect Him to employ some mode of address like the
following: “Thou bearest Mine own name, for thou art
both king and judge as I am; therefore I demand that
thou render account for thy stewardship, inasmuch as
thou art the appointed judge and leader of My people.”
Wherefore each one will need to prepare after long reflection
and with great care what he is to reply when
he comes before the Judge. If the archangel, in whom
there is no sign of weakness, gives his answer with fear
and trembling, when he is called upon to render account
for his services to our Lord and King, one can imagine
what fear and trembling will come upon a frail and sinful
man, when he is asked to render account for his
stewardship in the presence of God. But he who has
had this hall in his keeping will first of all be asked how
he has dealt out justice among men; and if he is unable
to give a satisfactory account, he may expect to hear
this sentence: “Thou wicked thrall, since thou hast not
observed justice in thy verdicts, thou shalt fare thither
where all verdicts are evil; for thine own mouth has
assigned thee to this place, inasmuch as it was not
ashamed to deliver dishonest judgments.” But if he
can defend the justice of his decisions with good reasons,
he shall find joy in his stewardship and hear these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>words: “Inasmuch as thou hast always observed equity
as a judge, it is fitting that thou shouldst enjoy a righteous
verdict on every count.” He will then be asked
further on what some of his actions were based; and
after that he will have to show how discreetly and carefully
he has kept all those things which God in the beginning
committed to this judgment seat. But if he has
not kept all those things which God in the beginning
assigned to the holy seat of judgment, he will be brought
face to face with those who have done their duty well,
such as Melchisedek or Moses or David or others who
have observed these things as faithfully as those named.
Then he will hear these words spoken: “If thou hadst
been as thoughtful and solicitous as these were in maintaining
the honors which I joined in the beginning to
My holy judgment seat, thou wouldst have received
the same rewards as these enjoy. But now thou shalt
be deprived of an honor here as great as the honor which
thou didst take without right from My judgment seat;
and to that degree shalt thou be regarded less in worth
and merit than those who have kept these honors unimpaired
which I entrusted to them. When thou wert
given charge of My judgment seat, it was not intended
that thou shouldst have power to dispose of services,
honors, and holy dignities in a manner different from
the one that I established in the beginning. For this
office was not given thee as an everlasting inheritance,
but it was committed to thee for a time only, that thou
mightest obtain an eternal reward, if thou didst guard it
faithfully. Thou wert given power to distribute worldly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>riches, gold and silver, though with discretion, but not
to dispose of the honors and glories of My holy judgment
seat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But if it is found that he has been discreet in his
charge, he shall have cause to rejoice in his stewardship;
he will, however, be examined in various lines. He will be
asked how he has used the rod of punishment which was
given into his hands; and it is very important that justice
shall have been strictly observed in penalties, lest it go
so ill with him as with King Saul, who failed to inflict
a just penalty which God had commanded him to execute
on the people who dwelt in Amalek, but slew unjustly
the bishop Ahimelech and all the priests in Nob.
But if it should go so ill with him who is thus called to
account for penalties inflicted, that he is found to have
stumbled in matters like those just mentioned and in
which King Saul fell, he will soon hear these words:
“Lead him yonder where King Saul and Herod and
Nero and others like them abide, and let him dwell
there with them, seeing that he wished to be like them
in cruelty.” Still, if in some cases he has been merciful
in sentence and punishment and if there is good reason
why he should escape the reproaches that we have just
mentioned, those facts will not be forgotten. For then
he shall find happiness in all his stewardship and very
soon shall hear this greeting: “Thou art welcome, thou
faithful servant and good friend, for thou hast loyally
kept a slight temporal dignity; now thou shalt come into
joyful possession of a great honor, constant and everlasting,
wholly free from sorrow and danger.” Happy
is he who is permitted to hear these words; but wretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>is he who shall hear those words of wrath which we
quoted earlier. But no one needs to doubt that everyone
who shall be called to account for his office and
stewardship will be addressed in one of these two ways.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LXX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE AUTHORITY OF KINGS AND BISHOPS.<br />END OF THE SECOND PART</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><i>Son.</i> I see clearly that one who is to watch over the
rules of the sacred law and deal out justice in all cases
is surely assigned a very difficult task. It is also evident
that King Solomon could not be called to account for
having Joab slain in God’s tabernacle, inasmuch as he
slew him for a just punishment, not out of enmity or in
hatred, as Cain slew his brother Abel. God’s tabernacle
was not defiled by Joab’s blood, seeing that it was not
shed in hatred; but the earth was defiled by Abel’s
blood, because it was shed in hatred. And I understand
fully that the sin and the desecration are caused by the
hatred and not by the punishment. But now you have
spoken of two halls which God has dedicated to His
service upon earth, and there are certain things that
concern these about which I wish to inquire. You have
stated that in one of them God has placed His judgment
seat; you have discussed that and also the office of him
who is in charge of it. You have also said that in the
other hall is God’s table, from which all God’s people
shall take spiritual food; and you added that the bishop
has been appointed keeper of this hall. Now I wish
to ask you why King Solomon removed Abiathar the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>bishop from the office that had been assigned to him,
namely that of keeper of the hall to which I have just
referred, and removed him so completely that he was
never afterwards allowed to put forth his hand to the
episcopal office, but was to live from that time on as a
churl or a plowboy. But I have thought that neither
of these two keepers can have authority to remove the
other from the office which has been committed to him.
Therefore I should like to have you point out a few
considerations which will make clear how King Solomon
could remove the bishop Abiathar from his office without
incurring reproof from God.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Father.</i> I called your attention to these facts to remind
you that both these halls are God’s houses and
both king and bishop the servants of God and keepers
of these houses; but they do not own them in the sense
that they can take anything away from them that was
assigned to them in the beginning. Therefore the king
must not pluck anything away from the house which
the bishop has in his keeping, for neither should rob
the other. And there should be no plundering of one by
the other, but each ought to support the other for the
same One owns both houses, namely God. I have also
told you that God has given the rod of punishment into
the hands of both the king and the bishop. The rod of
punishment that has been committed to the king is a
two-edged sword: with this sword it is his duty to smite
to the death everyone who tries to take anything away
from the sacred hall of which he is the guardian. But
the king’s sword is two-edged for the reason that it is
also his duty to guard the house which is in the bishop’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>keeping, if the bishop is unable to defend it with his
own rod of punishment. The bishop shall have his rod
of punishment in his mouth, and he shall smite with
words but not with hands like the king. And the bishop
shall strike his blow in the following manner: if any one
attempt to dishonor the sacred hall that is in his care,
he shall refuse him the table which is placed in this holy
house and the holy sustenance which is taken from this
table. But when King Solomon deprived Abiathar the
bishop of the episcopal office and dignity, he said that
Abiathar’s own guilt deprived him and not he. Since he
had decreed that David should forfeit his throne before
God had ordered it, and had chosen another king to
replace David, while he was still living, it was right to
deprive him of the episcopal office, seeing that he wanted
to rob David of the royal office. Saul’s guilt, on the
other hand, when he had slain the bishop Ahimelech
and all the priests in the city of Nob, was a grievous
burden, because he had done this without just cause.
But even if King Solomon should have killed the bishop
Abiathar, he would have been without guilt; for the
bishop had deprived the house of God of the lord whom
God Himself had appointed keeper of the holy judgment
seat. The bishop Abiathar had no right either to
appoint or to remove any one, as was later made evident;
for David chose the one whom he wished to be king in
his stead, and the choice which Abiathar had made was
of no effect. Abiathar the bishop obtained the episcopal
office through the will of David who appointed him to
it. Now you are to understand that there is this difference
between the business of a king and the duties of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>bishop: the bishop is appointed to be the king’s teacher,
counsellor, and guide, while the king is appointed to be
a judge and a man of severity in matters of punishment,
to the great terror of all who are subject to him. Nevertheless,
the bishop wields a rod of punishment as well
as the king. There is this difference, however, between
the king’s sword and that of the bishop, that the king’s
sword always bites when one strikes with it, and bites
to great injury when it is used without right, while it
serves him well whom it may strike when it is rightfully
used. But the bishop’s sword bites only when it is used
rightfully; when it is wrongfully used, it injures him
who smites with it, not him who is stricken. When the
bishop strikes rightfully, however, his sword wounds
even more deeply than the king’s. But this subject we
shall discuss more fully at some other time, if it is
thought advisable.</p>

seized it from below. Upon which the man from above said: ‘I am being

and then he goes from them swimming.” The translation is by Kuno Meyer:

of the companie to see her, one more came up and by that time shee was come
close to the ships side, looking earnestly on the men: a little after a sea came
and overturned her: from the navill upward her backe and breasts were like
a womans, as they say that saw her; her body as big as one of us; her

<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r247'>247</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this chapter the author has summed up the history of Norwegian kingship
in the twelfth century, when minorities were frequent and joint kingships
almost the rule. Three boys were proclaimed kings in 1103; two kings
shared the power in 1130; the royal title fell to three children in 1136. At no
time was the realm actually divided, the theory being that the administration
and the revenues might be divided, while the monarchy remained a unit.
The century was a period of great calamities; pretenders were numerous; and
civil war raged at intervals. For a fuller discussion of the theory of Norwegian
kingship in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, see above, pp. 35 ff.</p>

a wall and thus to make a breach. It is also called a “sow” and the Old Norse

<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r295'>295</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The story of the court proceedings in Paradise after the fall of man and the
discussion between Mercy and Peace on the one side and Truth and Justice
on the other was widely current in the thirteenth century. It made an important
scene in certain types of mystery plays, and it seems quite likely that the
source of the version given in the <i>King’s Mirror</i> must be sought in some dramatic
representation of the creation story. The account of the trial was made
the theme of two poems in Old French which have been attributed to the
English ecclesiastics Archbishop Langton and Bishop Grosseteste, both of
whom were contemporaries of our Norwegian author.</p>

<p class='c021'>Homilies were written on this theme in the twelfth century by St. Bernard
of Clairvaux (Migne, <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, CLXXXIII, 770) and by Hugh of St.
Victor (<i>ibid.</i>, CLXXVII, 623-626). There is a still earlier version of the story
in a homily attributed, though for no good reason, to the Venerable Bede.
According to this story a man has a son and four daughters named Mercy,
Truth, Peace, and Justice. He also has a servant whom he wishes to try by
giving him an easy task. The servant fails and is handed over to the
executioner. The daughters now come into violent disagreement, but the son
finds a way out of the difficulty: he saves the servant and succeeds in bringing
the sisters into agreement. <i>Ibid.</i>, XCIV, 505-507.</p>

<p class='c021'>W. Scherer, in <i>Zeitschrift für deutsche Altertumskunde</i>, N. F., IX, 414-416,
finds traces of the legend in Talmudic sources. In the Hebrew story, however,
the disagreement is over the expediency of creating man, Mercy favoring and
Truth opposing the project. The ultimate source appears to be <i>Psalms</i>,
lxxxv, 10: “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace
have kissed each other.”</p>
